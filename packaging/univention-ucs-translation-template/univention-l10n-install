"""
This script reads :file:`debian/*univention-l10n` files inside the current working
directory. It builds the message catalogs and installs them to the path defined
within.

The intended usage is to add it to the install target inside :file:`debian/rules` to
automate in-package translations.

Example file:`debian/rules` override::

	override_dh_auto_install:
		univention-l10n-install fr
		dh_auto_install
