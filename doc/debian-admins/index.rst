Univention Corporate Server for Debian and Ubuntu Administrators
################################################################

Welcome to the manual *Univention Corporate Server for Debian and Ubuntu
Administrators*. This document is for system administrators, system
engineers, or DevOps engineers with knowledge of the administration of Debian
GNU/Linux or Ubuntu systems who want to get started with |UCS|.

This document assumes that you are familiar with the following topics:

* Installing and updating computer systems running Debian GNU/Linux or Ubuntu

* A command line in a local or remote shell, such as bash

* A text editor on the command line, such as :program:`GNU nano`,
  :program:`Vim`, or :program:`Emacs`

* Installing and upgrading software using the package manager

* Configuring various services such as mail servers, LDAP servers and Samba

The document helps you avoid common pitfalls when starting to work with UCS if
you have a Debian GNU/Linux or Ubuntu background. The document doesn't describe
in detail how to do various tasks *the UCS way*. Instead, it points out the
differences and refers to the appropriate resources in existing product
documentation.

After reading this document, you have a general understanding of the differences
between Debian GNU/Linux or Ubuntu and |UCS|.

Your feedback is welcome and highly appreciated. If you have any comments,
suggestions, or criticisms, please `send your feedback
<https://www.univention.com/feedback/?debian-admins=generic>`_ to improve the
document.
