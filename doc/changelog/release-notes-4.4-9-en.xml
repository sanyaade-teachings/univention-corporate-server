	<chapter id="relnotes:update">
		<title>Notes about the update</title>
		<para>
			During the update some services in the domain may not be available temporarily, that is why the update should occur in a maintenance window.
			It is recommended to test the update in a separate test environment prior to the actual update.
			The test environment should be identical to the production environment.
			Depending on the system performance, network connection and the installed software the update will take between 20 minutes and several hours.
		</para>

		<section id="relnotes:order">
			<title>Recommended update order for environments with more than one UCS server</title>
			<para>
				In environments with more than one UCS system, the update order of the UCS systems must be borne in mind:
			</para>

			<para>
				The authoritative version of the LDAP directory service is maintained on the &ucsMaster; and replicated to all the remaining LDAP servers of the UCS domain.
				As changes to the LDAP schema can occur during release updates, the &ucsMaster; must always be the first system to be updated during a release update.
			</para>
		</section>

		<section id="relnotes:32bit">
			<title>UCS installation DVD only available for 64 bit</title>
			<para>
				Starting with UCS 4.0, installation DVD are only provided for the x86 64 bit architecture (amd64).
				Existing 32 bit UCS 3 systems can still be updated to UCS 4.0 through the online repository or by using update DVD.
				The 32 bit architecture will be supported over the entire UCS 4 maintenance period.
			</para>
		</section>
	</chapter>

	<chapter id="relnotes:prepare">
		<title>Preparation of update</title>

		<para>
			It must be checked whether sufficient disk space is available.
			A standard installation requires a minimum of 10 GB of disk space.
			The update requires approximately 4 GB additional disk space to download and install the packages, depending on the size of the existing installation.
		</para>

		<para>
			For the update, a login should be performed on the system's local console as user <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>, and the update should be initiated there.
			Alternatively, the update can be conducted using &ucsUMC;.
		</para>

		<para>
			Remote updating via SSH is not recommended as this may result in the update procedure being canceled, e.g., if the network connection is interrupted.
			In consequence, this can affect the system severely.
			If updating should occur over a network connection nevertheless, it must be verified that the update continues in case of disconnection from the network.
			This can be achieved, e.g., using the tools <command>screen</command> and <command>at</command>.
			These tools are installed on all UCS system roles by default.
		</para>

		<para>
			Univention provides a script that checks for problems which would prevent the successful update of the system.
			Prior to the update, this script can be downloaded and executed on the UCS system.

		<title>Postprocessing of the update</title>

		<para>
			Following the update, new or updated join scripts need to be executed.
			This can be done in two ways:
			Either using the UMC module  <guimenu>Domain join</guimenu> or by running the command
			<command>univention-run-join-scripts</command> as user <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>.

	<chapter id="relnotes:packages">
		<title>Notes on selected packages</title>

		<section id="relnotes:shim">
			<title>UEFI Secure Boot</title>
			<para>
				Secure Boot builds a chain of trust from the UEFI firmware to the Linux kernel.
				Any modification before the Linux kernel gets started is detected and aborts the boot process.
				This technique can be used to prevent boot viruses from infecting the system.
			</para>
			<para>
				In <ulink url="https://eclypsium.com/2020/07/29/theres-a-hole-in-the-boot/">July 2020</ulink> a major defect was detected in GRUB and the Linux kernel:
				Attackers can modify the environment before the Linux kernel is fully loaded and can disable secure boot.
				This affected nearly all Linux distributions including &ucsUCS;.
				Microsoft thus revoked all previously signed versions of <package>shim</package>, which breaks the secure boot chain at its earliest stage.
				As soon as the UEFI firmware is updated or Microsoft Windows runs on the same hardware and updates the list of revoked binaries, UCS 4.4 can no longer be booted.
			</para>
			<para>
				For 4.4-9 it was planed to update all components to have again a working UEFI installation with Secure Boot enabled.
				In the meantime new issues have been found in <package>grub2</package> and <package>shim</package>.
				Because of that Microsoft currently does not sign any version of <package>shim</package>.
				Therefor UCS 4.4-9 only ships with the new Linux Kernel 4.19.235;
				older versions will no longer be allowed in the future.
			</para>
			<para>
				An update of <package>grub2</package> and <package>shim</package> is planned for UCS 4.4-10.
				Until then the <emphasis>revoked</emphasis> version of <package>shim</package> will still be used.
				If the system no longer boots after updating the revocation lists, Secure Boot has to be turned off for the time being.
				Updating to UCS 5.0 is another alternative.
			</para>
		</section>

		<section id="relnotes:usage">
			<title>Collection of usage statistics</title>
			<para>
				Anonymous usage statistics on the use of &ucsUMC; are collected when using the <emphasis>UCS Core Edition</emphasis>.
				The modules opened get logged to an instance of the web traffic analysis tool Piwik.
				This makes it possible for Univention to tailor the development of &ucsUMC; better to customer needs and carry out usability improvements.
			</para>
			<para>
				This logging is only performed when the <emphasis>UCS Core Edition</emphasis> license is used.
				The license status can be verified via the menu entry <guimenu>License &ar; License information</guimenu> of the user menu in the upper right corner of &ucsUMC;.
				If <guimenu>UCS Core Edition</guimenu> is listed under <guimenu>License type</guimenu>, this version is in use.
				When a regular UCS license is used, no usage statistics are collected.
			</para>
			<para>
				Independent of the license used, the statistics generation can be deactivated by setting the &ucsUCRV; <envar>umc/web/piwik</envar> to <emphasis>false</emphasis>.
			</para>
		</section>

		<section id="relnotes:secbrowsers">
			<title>Scope of security support for WebKit, Konqueror and QtWebKit</title>
			<para>
				WebKit, Konqueror and QtWebKit are shipped in the maintained branch of the UCS repository, but not covered by security support.
				WebKit is primarily used for displaying HTML help pages etc.
				Firefox should be used as web browser.
			</para>
		</section>

		<section id="relnotes:browsers">
			<title>Recommended browsers for the access to &ucsUMC;</title>

			<para>
				&ucsUMC; uses numerous JavaScript and CSS functions to display the web interface.
				Cookies need to be permitted in the browser.
				The following browsers are recommended:
			</para>

			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Chrome as of version 71</para>

				<listitem>
					<para>Firefox as of version 60</para>
