 This update addresses the following issue:
 * `url::recvline` in `url.cpp` in libproxy 0.4.x through 0.4.15 allows a
   remote HTTP server to trigger uncontrolled recursion via a response
   composed of an infinite stream that lacks a newline character. This leads
   to stack exhaustion. (CVE-2020-25219)
