 This update addresses the following issue:
 * CVE-2023-43040: A flaw was found in Ceph Rados Gateway (RGW): An
   unprivileged user can write to any bucket(s) accessible by a given key if a
   POST's form-data contains a key called 'bucket' with a value matching the
   name of the bucket used to sign the request. The result of this is that a
   user could actually upload to any bucket accessible by the specified access
   key as long as the bucket in the POST policy matches the bucket in said
   POST form part.
