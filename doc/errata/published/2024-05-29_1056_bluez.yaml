 This update addresses the following issue:
 * CVE-2023-27349: Fix crash while handling unsupported events. This
   vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code
   via Bluetooth on affected installations of `BlueZ`. User interaction is
   required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must connect to a
   malicious device. The specific flaw exists within the handling of the AVRCP
   protocol. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of
   user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an
   allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute
   code in the context of root.
