fix: 2:4.18.3-1A~5.0.0.202311271227
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The package `samba-ad-dc` now depends on a specific version of
   `samba-dsdb-modules` to upgrade the initially installed version to the one
   required during installation. This addresses issues when an ISO image was
   used for installation that did not already include the latest Samba version
   provided by later errata updates.
 * Symbolic links in the directory `sysvol` will no longer break the Samba
   backup tool.
 * The package `samba-ad-dc` now depends on a specific version of
   `samba-ad-provision`, instead of only recommending it. This addresses
   issues when installing directly from the UCS 5.0-6 ISO image.
