desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2022-1552: There is an issue with incomplete efforts to operate safely
   when a privileged user is maintaining another user's objects. The commands
   `AUTOVACUUM`, `REINDEX`, `CREATE INDEX`, `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW`,
   `CLUSTER`, and `pg_amcheck` activated relevant protections too late or not
   at all during the process. This flaw allows an attacker with permission to
   create non-temporary objects in at least one schema to execute arbitrary
   SQL functions under a superuser identity.
 * CVE-2022-2625: This attack requires permission to create non-temporary
   objects in at least one schema, the ability to lure or wait for an
   administrator to create or update an affected extension in that schema, and
   the ability to lure or wait for a victim to use the object targeted in
   `CREATE OR REPLACE` or `CREATE IF NOT EXISTS`. Given all three
   prerequisites, this flaw allows an attacker to run arbitrary code as the
   victim role, which may be a superuser.
