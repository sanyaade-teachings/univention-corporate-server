desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Fix a regression in CVE-2021-3177: ISO C90 forbids mixed declarations and
   code.
 * CVE-2022-48560: A use-after-free exists in Python via `heappushpop` in
   `heapq`.
 * CVE-2022-48564: Potential DoS in `read_ints` in `plistlib.py`.
 * CVE-2022-48564: DoS attack via CPU and RAM exhaustion when processing
   malformed Apple Property List files in binary format.
 * CVE-2022-48565: Avoid XML External Entity (XXE) issues by rejecting entity
   declarations in XML plist files in `plistlib`.
 * CVE-2022-48566: An issue was discovered in `compare_digest` in
   `Lib`/hmac.py. Constant-time-defeating optimisations were possible in the
   accumulator variable in `hmac.compare_digest`, that would facilitate a side
   channel type attack.
 * CVE-2023-40217: Fix a race condition in TLS handling. If a TLS server-side
   socket is created, receives data into the socket buffer, and then is closed
   quickly, there is a brief window where the `SSLSocket` instance will detect
   the socket as "not connected" and won't initiate a handshake, but buffered
   data will still be readable from the socket buffer. This data will not be
   authenticated if the server-side TLS peer is expecting client certificate
   authentication, and is indistinguishable from valid TLS stream data. Data
   is limited in size to the amount that will fit in the buffer. The TLS
   connection cannot directly be used for data exfiltration because the
   vulnerable code path requires that the connection be closed on
   initialization of the `SSLSocket`.
