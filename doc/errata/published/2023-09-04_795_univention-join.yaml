fix: 12.0.5-6
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The default timeout for initial replication of the DNS host record of a
   joining system can now be adjusted by making use of the new UCR variable
   `join/samba/dns/replication/timeout` which has the old default value of
   600 seconds. This is only necessary in large environments where the
   initial replication from UDM/OpenLDAP to Samba/AD may be delayed due to
   a large number of objects.
 * The package has been backported to UCS 5.0-3 to resolve a dependency
   problem, so that univention-samba4 is not removed during the update to
   UCS 5.0-4.
