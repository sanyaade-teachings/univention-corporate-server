desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * Fix CVE-2022-2526: A use-after-free vulnerability was found in `systemd`.
   This issue occurs due to the functions `on_stream_io()` and
   `dns_stream_complete()` in `resolved-dns-stream.c` not incrementing the
   reference counting for the DnsStream object. Therefore, other functions and
   callbacks called can dereference the DNSStream object, causing the
   use-after-free when the reference is still used later.
