 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2023-43490: Incorrect calculation in microcode keying mechanism for
   some `Intel(R)` `Xeon(R)` `D Processors` with `Intel(R) SGX` may allow a
   privileged user to potentially enable information disclosure via local
   access.
 * CVE-2023-39368: Protection mechanism failure of bus lock regulator for some
   `Intel(R)` Processors may allow an unauthenticated user to potentially
   enable denial of service via network access.
 * CVE-2023-38575: Non-transparent sharing of return predictor targets between
   contexts in some `Intel(R) Processors` may allow an authorized user to
   potentially enable information disclosure via local access.
 * CVE-2023-22655: Protection mechanism failure in some 3rd and 4th Generation
   `Intel(R)` `Xeon(R)` `Processors` when using` Intel(R) SGX` or `Intel(R)
   TDX` may allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of
   privilege via local access.
 * CVE-2023-28746: Information exposure through microarchitectural state after
   transient execution from some register files for some `Intel(R)` `Atom(R)`
   Processors may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable
   information disclosure via local access.
 * CVE-2023-23583: Sequence of processor instructions leads to unexpected
   behavior for some `Intel(R)` Processors may allow an authenticated user to
   potentially enable escalation of privilege and/or information disclosure
   and/or denial of service via local access.
