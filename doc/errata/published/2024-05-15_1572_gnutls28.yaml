 This update addresses the following issue:
 * CVE-2021-4209: A `NULL` pointer dereference flaw was found in `GnuTLS`. As
   Nettle's hash update functions internally call `memcpy`, providing
   zero-length input may cause undefined behavior. This flaw leads to a denial
   of service after authentication in rare circumstances.
