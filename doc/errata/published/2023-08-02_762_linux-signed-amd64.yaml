desc: |
 This updates the Linux kernel to version 4.19.289, which addresses (among
 others) the following security issues:
 * CVE-2023-1380: A slab-out-of-bound read problem was found in
   `brcmf_get_assoc_ies` in
   `drivers/net/wireless/broadcom/brcm80211/brcmfmac/cfg80211.c` in the Linux
   Kernel. This issue could occur when `assoc_info->req_len` data is bigger
   than the size of the buffer, defined as `WL_EXTRA_BUF_MAX`, leading to a
   denial of service.
 * CVE-2023-2002: A vulnerability was found in the `HCI` sockets
   implementation due to a missing capability check in
   `net/bluetooth/hci_sock.c` in the Linux Kernel. This flaw allows an
   attacker to unauthorized execution of management commands, compromising the
   confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Bluetooth communication.
 * CVE-2023-2007: The specific flaw exists within the "DPT I2O Controller"
   driver. The issue results from the lack of proper locking when performing
   operations on an object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with
   other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in
   the context of the kernel.
 * CVE-2023-2269: A denial of service problem was found, due to a possible
   recursive locking scenario, resulting in a deadlock in `table_clear` in
   `drivers/md/dm-ioctl.c` in the Linux Kernel Device Mapper-Multipathing
   sub-component.
 * CVE-2023-3090: A heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Linux Kernel
   `ipvlan` network driver can be exploited to achieve local privilege
   escalation. The out-of-bounds write is caused by missing `skb->cb`
   initialization in the `ipvlan` network driver. The vulnerability is
   reachable if `CONFIG_IPVLAN` is enabled.
 * CVE-2023-3111: A use after free vulnerability was found in
   `prepare_to_relocate` in `fs/btrfs/relocation.c` in `btrfs` in the Linux
   Kernel. This possible flaw can be triggered by calling
   `btrfs_ioctl_balance()` before calling `btrfs_ioctl_defrag()`.
 * CVE-2023-3141: A use-after-free flaw was found in `r592_remove` in
   `drivers/memstick/host/r592.c` in media access in the Linux Kernel. This
   flaw allows a local attacker to crash the system at device disconnect,
   possibly leading to a kernel information leak.
 * CVE-2023-3268: An out of bounds (OOB) memory access flaw was found in the
   Linux kernel in `relay_file_read_start_pos` in `kernel/relay.c` in the
   `relayfs`. This flaw could allow a local attacker to crash the system or
   leak kernel internal information.
 * CVE-2023-3338: A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux
   kernel's `DECnet` networking protocol. This issue could allow a remote user
   to crash the system.
 * CVE-2023-20593: An issue in “Zen 2” CPUs, under specific microarchitectural
   circumstances, may allow an attacker to potentially access sensitive
   information.
 * CVE-2023-31084: An issue was discovered in
   `drivers/media/dvb-core/dvb_frontend.c` in the Linux kernel. There is a
   blocking operation when a task is in `!TASK_RUNNING`. In
   `dvb_frontend_get_event`, `wait_event_interruptible` is called; the
   condition is `dvb_frontend_test_event(fepriv,events)`. In
   `dvb_frontend_test_event`, `down(&fepriv->sem)` is called. However,
   `wait_event_interruptible` would put the process to sleep, and
   `down(&fepriv->sem)` may block the process.
 * CVE-2023-32233: A use-after-free in `Netfilter nf_tables` when processing
   batch requests can be abused to perform arbitrary read and write operations
   on kernel memory. Unprivileged local users can obtain root privileges. This
   occurs because anonymous sets are mishandled.
 * CVE-2023-34256: There is an out-of-bounds read in `crc16` in `lib/crc16.c`
   when called from `fs/ext4/super.c` because `ext4_group_desc_csum` does not
   properly check an offset.
 * CVE-2023-35788: An issue in `fl_set_geneve_opt` in `net/sched/cls_flower.c`
   in the Linux kernel allows an out-of-bounds write in the flower classifier
   code via `TCA_FLOWER_KEY_ENC_OPTS_GENEVE` packets. This may result in
   denial of service or privilege escalation.
 * CVE-2023-35823: A use-after-free was found in `saa7134_finidev` in
   `drivers/media/pci/saa7134/saa7134-core.c`.
 * CVE-2023-35824: A use-after-free was found in `dm1105_remove` in
   `drivers/media/pci/dm1105/dm1105.c`.
