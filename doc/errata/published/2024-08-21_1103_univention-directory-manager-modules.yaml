fix: 15.0.27-7
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The LDAP attribute `shadowExpire` was calculated in a
   way which resulted in users expiring one day later than
   expected in certain timezones. This has been corrected.
 * The UDM module `settings/directory` provides the default
   container setting for other UDM modules. It is now possible
   to extend `settings/directory` with an extended attribute to
   define default containers for custom UDM modules.
   The name of the `settings/directory` property, that defines
   the default container for your module, can be defined by the
   variable `default_containers_attribute_name` in the module.
