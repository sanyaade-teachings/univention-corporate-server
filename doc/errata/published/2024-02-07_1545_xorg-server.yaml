desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2023-6816: A flaw was found in X.Org server. Both `DeviceFocusEvent`
   and the `XIQueryPointer` reply contain a bit for each logical button
   currently down. Buttons can be arbitrarily mapped to any value up to `255`,
   but the X.Org Server was only allocating space for the device's particular
   number of buttons, leading to a heap overflow if a bigger value was used.
 * CVE-2024-0229: Reattaching to different master device may lead to
   out-of-bounds memory access.
 * CVE-2024-21885: Heap buffer overflow in `XISendDeviceHierarchyEvent`.
 * CVE-2024-21886: Heap buffer overflow in `DisableDevice`.
