fix: 13.0.2-19A~4.4.0.201906131827
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * A trivial UCR syntax error has been fixed in the joinscript
 * Remove lockingdb and s4cache during re-join
 * When the S4-Connector starts, it logged the group cache initialization
   at level INFO. In debugging situations that can lead to a lot of output
   in `connector-s4.log` which ist hard to scroll. The log volume of the
   group cache init has been lowered to log level ALL.
 * The scripts `remove_ucs_rejected.py` and `remove_s4_rejected.py` now
   escapes SQL syntax.
 * Avoid rejects when DNS records have an uppercase DC attribute.
 * Fix traceback password `sync_to_ucs` for machine accounts.
