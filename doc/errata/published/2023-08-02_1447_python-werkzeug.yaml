desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2023-23934: `Werkzeug` will parse the cookie `=__Host-test=bad` as
   __Host-test=bad`. If a `Werkzeug` application is running next to a
   vulnerable or malicious subdomain which sets such a cookie using a
   vulnerable browser, the `Werkzeug` application will see the bad cookie
   value but the valid cookie key. Browsers may allow `"nameless"` cookies
   that look like `=value` instead of `key=value`. A vulnerable browser may
   allow a compromised application on an adjacent subdomain to exploit this
   to set a cookie like `=__Host-test=bad` for another subdomain.
 * CVE-2023-25577: `Werkzeug's` multipart form data parser will parse an
   unlimited number of parts, including file parts. Parts can be a small
   amount of bytes, but each requires CPU time to parse and may use more
   memory as Python data. If a request can be made to an endpoint that
   accesses `request.data`, `request.form`, `request.files`, or
   `request.get_data(parse_form_data=False)`, it can cause unexpectedly high
   resource usage. This allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by
   sending crafted multipart data to an endpoint that will parse it.
