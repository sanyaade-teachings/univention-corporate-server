 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2022-39282: FreeRDP based clients on unix systems using `/parallel`
   command line switch might read uninitialized data and send it to the
   server the client is currently connected to.
 * CVE-2022-39318: missing input validation in `urbdrc` channel. A
   malicious server can trick a FreeRDP based client to crash with division
   by zero.
 * CVE-2022-39319: missing input length validation in the `urbdrc` channel.
   A malicious server can trick a FreeRDP based client to read out of bound
   data and send it back to the server.
 * CVE-2022-39347: missing path canonicalization and base path check for
   `drive` channel. A malicious server can trick a FreeRDP based client to
   read files outside the shared directory.
 * CVE-2022-41877: missing input length validation in `drive` channel. A
   malicious server can trick a FreeRDP based client to read out of bound
   data and send it back to the server.
 * CVE-2023-39353: missing offset validation leading to Out Of Bound Read.
   In the `libfreerdp/codec/rfx.c` file there is no offset validation in
   `tile->quantIdxY`, `tile->quantIdxCb`, and `tile->quantIdxCr`. As a result
   crafted input can lead to an out of bounds read access which in turn will
   cause a crash.
 * CVE-2023-39354: Out-Of-Bounds Read in the `nsc_rle_decompress_data`
   function. The Out-Of-Bounds Read occurs because it processes
   `context->Planes` without checking if it contains data of sufficient
   length. Should an attacker be able to leverage this vulnerability they may
   be able to cause a crash.
 * CVE-2023-39356: missing offset validation may lead to an Out Of Bound
   Read in the function `gdi_multi_opaque_rect`. In particular there is no
   code to validate if the value `multi_opaque_rect->numRectangles` is less
   than 45. Looping through `multi_opaque_rect->`numRectangles without proper
   boundary checks can lead to Out-of-Bounds Read errors which will likely
   lead to a crash.
 * CVE-2023-40188: Out-Of-Bounds Read in the `nsc_rle_decode` function.
   This Out-Of-Bounds Read occurs because processing is done on the `in`
   variable without checking if it contains data of sufficient length.
   Insufficient data for the `in` variable may cause errors or crashes.
 * CVE-2020-11524: `libfreerdp/codec/interleaved.c` in FreeRDP versions > 1.0
   through 2.0.0-rc4 has an Out-of-bounds Write.
