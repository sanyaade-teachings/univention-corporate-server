fix: 481-2.1+deb9u1
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2022-48624: `close_altfile` in `filename.c` in less before ``606``
   omits `shell_quote` calls for `LESSCLOSE`.
 * CVE-2024-32487: `less` through `653` allows OS command execution via a
   newline character in the name of a file, because quoting is mishandled in
   `filename.c`. Exploitation typically requires use with attacker-controlled
   file names, such as the files extracted from an untrusted archive.
   Exploitation also requires the `LESSOPEN` environment variable, but this is
   set by default in many common cases.
