 This update addresses the following issue:
 * CVE-2024-3651: A vulnerability was identified in the `kjd/idna` library,
   specifically within the `idna.encode()` function. The issue arises from the
   function's handling of crafted input strings, which can lead to quadratic
   complexity and consequently, a denial of service condition. This
   vulnerability is triggered by a crafted input that causes the
   `idna.encode()` function to process the input with considerable
   computational load, significantly increasing the processing time in a
   quadratic manner relative to the input size.
