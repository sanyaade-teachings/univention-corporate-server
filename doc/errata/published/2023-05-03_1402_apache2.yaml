desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2006-20001: A carefully crafted `If:` request header can cause a memory
   read, or write of a single zero byte, in a pool (heap) memory location
   beyond the header value sent. This could cause the process to crash.
 * CVE-2022-36760: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ("HTTP Request
   Smuggling") vulnerability in `mod_proxy_ajp` of Apache HTTP Server allows
   an attacker to smuggle requests to the AJP server it forwards requests to.
 * CVE-2022-37436: A malicious backend can cause the response headers to be
   truncated early, resulting in some headers being incorporated into the
   response body. If the later headers have any security purpose, they will
   not be interpreted by the client.
 * CVE-2023-25690: Some `mod_proxy` configurations allow a HTTP Request
   Smuggling attack. Configurations are affected when `mod_proxy` is enabled
   along with some form of `RewriteRule` or `ProxyPassMatch` in which a
   non-specific pattern matches some portion of the user-supplied
   request-target (URL) data and is then re-inserted into the proxied
   request-target using variable substitution.
