fix: 15.0.24-10
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * When computer objects were assigned with a network the DHCP and DNS
   settings weren't saved if a custom IP was specified. This has been
   corrected.
 * Values for the "complex" syntax class can now contain double quotes.
 * It is possible again to detect, search and modify users/ldap objects which
   have `univentionObjectFlag=functional`.
 * The displayed description of objects is now more accurate,
   for example for OX IMAP folder objects did not include
   the domain name which made it difficult to differentiate
   folder names for different domains.
 * The AttributeHook class was not idempotent and caused errors when multiple
   `open()` calls have been done. This is for example the case in the
   UCS@school importer.
