desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * An issue was discovered in `wpa_supplicant` that resulted in loading
   of arbitrary shared objects, which allows a local unprivileged attacker
   to escalate privileges to the user that `wpa_supplicant` runs as
   (usually root). Membership in the `netdev` group or access to the `dbus`
   interface of `wpa_supplicant` allow an unprivileged user to specify an
   arbitrary path to a module to be loaded by the `wpa_supplicant` process.
   Now it only loads libraries from trusted paths.
   (CVE-2024-5290).
