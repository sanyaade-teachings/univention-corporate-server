 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Fix CVE-2022-26651: The module `func_odbc` provides possibly inadequate
   escaping functionality for backslash characters in SQL queries, resulting
   in user-provided data creating a broken SQL query or possibly a SQL
   injection.
 * Fix CVE-2020-35776: A buffer overflow in `res_pjsip_diversion.c` allows
   remote attackers to crash Asterisk by deliberately misusing SIP 181
   responses.
