desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2023-50387: Certain `DNSSEC` aspects of the DNS protocol (in RFC 4033,
   4034, 4035, 6840, and related RFCs) allow remote attackers to cause a
   denial of service (CPU consumption) via one or more `DNSSEC` responses, aka
   the "KeyTrap" issue. One of the concerns is that, when there is a zone with
   many `DNSKEY` and `RRSIG` records, the protocol specification implies that
   an algorithm must evaluate all combinations of DNSKEY and RRSIG records.
 * CVE-2023-50868: The Closest Encloser Proof aspect of the DNS protocol (in
   RFC 5155 when RFC 9276 guidance is skipped) allows remote attackers to
   cause a denial of service (CPU consumption for SHA-1 computations) via
   `DNSSEC` responses in a random subdomain attack, aka the "NSEC3" issue. The
   RFC 5155 specification implies that an algorithm must perform thousands of
   iterations of a hash function in certain situations.
