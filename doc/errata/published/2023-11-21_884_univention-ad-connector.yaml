desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * During synchronization from an MS AD forest child domain, the AD connector
   may receive DNs that refer to objects outside the scope of the child
   domain. In that case it receives an LDAP referral which caused a Python
   traceback. The AD-Connector now skips referrals to objects and logs an
   informative message instead.
