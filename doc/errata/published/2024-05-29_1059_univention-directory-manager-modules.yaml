fix: 15.0.26-12
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * If the UCR variable `directory/manager/mail-address/uniqueness`
   is set to `true` the uniqueness check for email addresses takes
   both user properties, `mailPrimaryAddress` and
   `mailAlternativeAddress`, into account. It is now possible to
   swap the values for these properties with one change to the
   user object.
 * The udm module `settings/extended_attributes` has been updated to
   include the property `preventUmcDefaultPopup` which is evaluated
   in the `UMC` and will inhibit it from warning the user that
   the default value of a property will be set during modification.
