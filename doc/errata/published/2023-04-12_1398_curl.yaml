fix: 7.52.1-5+deb9u19
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2023-27533: A vulnerability in input validation exists in curl during
   communication using the TELNET protocol may allow an attacker to pass on
   maliciously crafted user name and "telnet options" during server
   negotiation. The lack of proper input scrubbing allows an attacker to send
   content or perform option negotiation without the application's intent.
   This vulnerability could be exploited if an application allows user input,
   thereby enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code on the system.
 * CVE-2023-27535: An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in libcurl in
   the FTP connection reuse feature that can result in wrong credentials being
   used during subsequent transfers. Previously created connections are kept
   in a connection pool for reuse if they match the current setup. However,
   certain FTP settings such as CURLOPT_FTP_ACCOUNT,
   CURLOPT_FTP_ALTERNATIVE_TO_USER, CURLOPT_FTP_SSL_CCC, and CURLOPT_USE_SSL
   were not included in the configuration match checks, causing them to match
   too easily. This could lead to libcurl using the wrong credentials when
   performing a transfer, potentially allowing unauthorized access to
   sensitive information.
 * CVE-2023-27536: An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in libcurl in
   the connection reuse feature which can reuse previously established
   connections with incorrect user permissions due to a failure to check for
   changes in the CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION option. This vulnerability affects
   krb5/kerberos/negotiate/GSSAPI transfers and could potentially result in
   unauthorized access to sensitive information. The safest option is to not
   reuse connections if the CURLOPT_GSSAPI_DELEGATION option has been changed.
 * CVE-2023-27538: An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in libcurl
   where it reuses a previously established SSH connection despite the fact
   that an SSH option was modified, which should have prevented reuse. libcurl
   maintains a pool of previously used connections to reuse them for
   subsequent transfers if the configurations match. However, two SSH settings
   were omitted from the configuration check, allowing them to match easily,
   potentially leading to the reuse of an inappropriate connection.
