desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Fix CVE-2021-21300: a specially crafted repository that contains symbolic
   links as well as files using a clean/smudge filter such as Git LFS, may
   cause just-checked out script to be executed while cloning onto a
   case-insensitive file system such as NTFS, HFS+ or APFS (i.e. the default
   file systems on Windows and macOS).
 * Fix CVE-2021-40330: `git_connect_git` in `connect.c` allows a repository
   path to contain a newline character, which may result in unexpected
   cross-protocol requests, as demonstrated by the
   git://localhost:1234/%0d%0a%0d%0aGET%20/%20HTTP/1.1 substring.
