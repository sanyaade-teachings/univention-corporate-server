desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * A vulnerability in the ARJ archive parsing module in Clam AntiVirus
   (ClamAV) Software versions 0.102.2 could allow an unauthenticated, remote
   attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device. The
   vulnerability is due to a heap buffer overflow read. An attacker could
   exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted ARJ file to an affected
   device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning
   process crash, resulting in a denial of service condition. (CVE-2020-3327)
 * A vulnerability in the endpoint software of Cisco AMP for Endpoints and
   Clam AntiVirus could allow an authenticated, local attacker to cause the
   running software to delete arbitrary files on the system. The vulnerability
   is due to a race condition that could occur when scanning malicious files.
   An attacker with local shell access could exploit this vulnerability by
   executing a script that could trigger the race condition. A successful
   exploit could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files on the system
   that the attacker would not normally have privileges to delete, producing
   system instability or causing the endpoint software to stop working.
   (CVE-2020-3350)
 * A vulnerability in the EGG archive parsing module in Clam AntiVirus
   (ClamAV) Software versions 0.102.0 - 0.102.3 could allow an
   unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition on
   an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a NULL pointer dereference.
   An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted EGG file
   to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the
   ClamAV scanning process crash, resulting in a denial of service condition.
