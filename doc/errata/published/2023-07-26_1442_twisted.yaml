fix: 16.6.0-2+deb9u4
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2019-12387: twisted.web did not validate or sanitize URIs or HTTP
   methods, allowing an attacker to inject invalid characters such as CRLF.
 * CVE-2019-12855: In `words.protocols.jabber.xmlstream` in Twisted through
   19.2.1, XMPP support did not verify certificates when used with TLS,
   allowing an attacker to MITM connections.
 * CVE-2022-39348: When the host header does not match a configured host
   `twisted.web.vhost.NameVirtualHost` will return a `NoResource` resource
   which renders the Host header unescaped into the 404 response allowing
   HTML and script injection. In practice this should be very difficult to
   exploit as being able to modify the Host header of a normal HTTP request
   implies that one is already in a privileged position.
