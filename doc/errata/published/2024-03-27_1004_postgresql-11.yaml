desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * CVE-2024-0985: Late privilege drop in `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW
   CONCURRENTLY` in PostgreSQL allows an object creator to execute arbitrary
   `SQL` functions as the command issuer. The command intends to run `SQL`
   functions as the owner of the materialized view, enabling safe refresh of
   untrusted materialized views. The victim is a superuser or member of one
   of the attacker's roles. The attack requires luring the victim into
   running `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY` on the attacker's
   materialized view. As part of exploiting this vulnerability, the attacker
   creates functions that use `CREATE RULE` to convert the internally-built
   temporary table to a view.
