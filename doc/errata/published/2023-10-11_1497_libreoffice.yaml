desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2023-2255: Improper access control in editor components of
   LibreOffice allowed an attacker to craft a document that would cause
   external links to be loaded without prompt. In the affected versions of
   LibreOffice documents that used "floating frames" linked to external
   files, would load the contents of those frames without prompting the user
   for permission to do so. This was inconsistent with the treatment of other
   linked content in LibreOffice.
 * CVE-2022-3874: Libreoffice may be configured to add an empty entry to
   the Java class path. This may lead to run arbitrary Java code from the
   current directory.
 * CVE-2023-0950: Improper Validation of Array Index vulnerability in the
   spreadsheet component allows an attacker to craft a spreadsheet document
   that will cause an array index underflow when loaded. In the affected
   versions of LibreOffice certain malformed spreadsheet formulas, such as
   AGGREGATE, could be created with less parameters passed to the formula
   interpreter than it expected, leading to an array index underflow, in
   which case there is a risk that arbitrary code could be executed.
 * CVE-2022-26307: add Initialization Vectors to password storage.
   LibreOffice supports the storage of passwords for web connections in the
   user’s configuration database. The stored passwords are encrypted with a
   single master key provided by the user. A flaw in LibreOffice existed
   where master key was poorly encoded resulting in weakening its entropy
   from 128 to 43 bits making the stored passwords vulerable to a brute force
   attack if an attacker has access to the users stored config.
 * CVE-2022-26306: LibreOffice supports the storage of passwords for web
   connections in the user’s configuration database. The stored passwords are
   encrypted with a single master key provided by the user. A flaw in
   LibreOffice existed where the required initialization vector for
   encryption was always the same which weakens the security of the
   encryption making them vulnerable if an attacker has access to the user's
   configuration data
 * CVE-2022-26305: compare authors using Thumbprint An Improper Certificate
   Validation vulnerability in LibreOffice existed where determining if a
   macro was signed by a trusted author was done by only matching the serial
   number and issuer string of the used certificate with that of a trusted
   certificate. This is not sufficient to verify that the macro was actually
   signed with the certificate. An adversary could therefore create an
   arbitrary certificate with a serial number and an issuer string identical
   to a trusted certificate which LibreOffice would present as belonging to
   the trusted author, potentially leading to the user to execute arbitrary
   code contained in macros improperly trusted.
 * CVE-2021-25636: only use X509Data LibreOffice supports digital
   signatures of ODF documents and macros within documents, presenting visual
   aids that no alteration of the document occurred since the last signing
   and that the signature is valid. An Improper Certificate Validation
   vulnerability in LibreOffice allowed an attacker to create a digitally
   signed ODF document, by manipulating the documentsignatures.xml or
   macrosignatures.xml stream within the document to contain both "X509Data"
   and "KeyValue" children of the "KeyInfo" tag, which when opened caused
   LibreOffice to verify using the "KeyValue" but to report verification with
   the unrelated "X509Data" value.
 * CVE-2022-3140: Insufficient validation of "vnd.libreoffice.command" URI
   schemes. LibreOffice supports Office URI Schemes to enable browser
   integration of LibreOffice with MS SharePoint server. An additional scheme
   'vnd.libreoffice.command' specific to LibreOffice was added. In the
   affected versions of LibreOffice links using that scheme could be
   constructed to call internal macros with arbitrary arguments. Which when
   clicked on, or activated by document events, could result in arbitrary
   script execution without warning.
 * CVE-2018-1055: Remote arbitrary file disclosure
   vulnerability via WEBSERVICE formula
 * CVE-2019-9854: Unsafe URL assembly flaw in allowed script location
   check.
 * CVE-2019-9855: Windows 8.3 path equivalence handling flaw allows
   LibreLogo script execution.
 * CVE-2018-6871: Remote arbitrary file
   disclosure vulnerability via WEBSERVICE formula.
 * CVE-2019-9848: LibreLogo script can be manipulated into executing
   arbitrary python commands.
 * CVE-2018-16858: Arbitrary python functions
   in arbitrary modules on the filesystem can be executed without warning.
 * CVE-2019-9850: Insufficient url validation allowing LibreLogo script
   execution.
 * CVE-2019-9851: LibreLogo global-event script execution.
 * CVE-2019-9852: Insufficient URL encoding flaw in allowed script location
   check.
 * CVE-2019-9853: Insufficient URL decoding flaw in categorizing macro
   location.
 * CVE-2019-9849: Remote resources protection module not applied to bullet
   graphics.
