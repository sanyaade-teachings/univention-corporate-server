desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The property `groups` of UDM objects `users/user` are now resolved via
   the attribute `memberOf` instead of a manual search for group memberships
   to increase performance.
   Using the group memberships via `memberOf` adds all groups to the user
   which he is assigned to, even if the reading user cannot read the
   specific groups of if the memberships are no groups/group objects.
   As there might be code which relies on this behavior and don't do proper
   error handling when iterating over group memberships the new UCR variable
   `directory/manager/user/group-memberships-via-memberof` can be used to
   restore the old behavior. The variable is going to be removed in UCS 5.1.
