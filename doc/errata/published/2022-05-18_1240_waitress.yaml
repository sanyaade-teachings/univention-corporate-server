fix: 1.0.1-1+deb9u1
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * HTTP request smuggling through LF vs CRLF handling (CVE-2019-16785)
 * HTTP request smuggling through invalid Transfer-Encoding (CVE-2019-16786)
 * HTTP Request Smuggling through Invalid white-space characters in headers
   (CVE-2019-16789)
 * HTTP request smuggling by sending the Content-Length header twice. Waitress
   would header fold a double Content-Length header and due to being unable to
   cast the now comma separated value to an integer would set the
   Content-Length to 0 internally. If two Content-Length headers are sent in a
   single request, Waitress would treat the request as having no body, thereby
   treating the body of the request as a new request in HTTP pipelining.
   (CVE-2019-16792)
 * Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request Smuggling')
   (CVE-2022-24761)
