fix: 5.0.1-23A~4.4.0.201911081459
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The package now uses `dh_python2` instead of `python-support`.
   Therefore Python modules are installed into
   `/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/univention/management/console/modules/`.
 * A broken test for filesystem permissions has been removed.
