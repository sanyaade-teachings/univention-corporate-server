desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * CVE-2024-0985: Late privilege
   drop in `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY` in PostgreSQL allows an
   object creator to execute arbitrary `SQL` functions as the command issuer.
   The command intends to run `SQL` functions as the owner of the
   materialized view, enabling safe refresh of untrusted materialized views.
   The victim is a superuser or member of one of the attacker's roles. The
   attack requires luring the victim into running `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW
   CONCURRENTLY` on the attacker's materialized view. As part of exploiting
   this vulnerability, the attacker creates functions that use `CREATE RULE`
   to convert the internally-built temporary table to a view.
