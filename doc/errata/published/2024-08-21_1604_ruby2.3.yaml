fix: 2.3.3-1+deb9u12
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The gem `REXML` does not properly address XML round-trip issues.
   An incorrect document can be produced after parsing and serializing
   (CVE-2021-28965).
 * The gem `cgi` allows HTTP response splitting. This is relevant
   to applications that use untrusted user input either to generate
   an HTTP response or to create a `CGI::Cookie` object (CVE-2021-33621).
 * A buffer over-read occurs in `String-to-Float` conversion, including
   `Kernel#Float` and `String#to_f` (CVE-2022-28739).
 * A regular expression related denial of service (ReDoS) issue was
   discovered. The URI parser mishandles invalid URLs that have specific
   characters. This causes an increase in execution time for parsing strings
   to URI objects (CVE-2023-28755).
 * Another ReDoS issue was discovered in the Time component. The Time parser
   mishandles invalid URLs that have specific characters. This causes an
   increase in execution time for parsing strings to Time objects
   (CVE-2023-28756).
 * A ReDoS issue was in the URI parser mishandles invalid URLs that have
   specific characters. This is a follow-up fix for CVE-2023-28755
   (CVE-2023-36617).
 * When parsing `.rdoc_options` as a YAML file, object injection and resultant
   remote code execution are possible because there are no restrictions on
   the classes that can be restored  (CVE-2024-27281).
 * If attacker-supplied data is provided to the Ruby regex compiler,
   it is possible to extract arbitrary heap data relative to the start of
   the text, including pointers and sensitive strings (CVE-2024-27282).
