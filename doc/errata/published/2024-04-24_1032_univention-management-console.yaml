 This update addresses the following issues:
 * If the primary UCS server is on UCS version 5.2-0
   or higher, UMC will no longer create or
   configure a client for simpleSAMLphp.
 * The option `copytruncate` has been added to the `logrotate`
   configuration of UMC to not delete log files but to
   truncate the original log file to zero size in place.
