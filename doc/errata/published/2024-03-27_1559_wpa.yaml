desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * CVE-2023-52160: The implementation of `PEAP` in `wpa_supplicant` allows
   authentication bypass. For a successful attack, `wpa_supplicant` must be
   configured to not verify the network's `TLS` certificate during Phase 1
   authentication, and an `eap_peap_decrypt` vulnerability can then be abused
   to skip Phase 2 authentication. This allows an adversary to impersonate
   Enterprise Wi-Fi networks.
