 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2022-40303: Parsing a XML document with the option `XML_PARSE_HUGE`
   enabled can result in an integer overflow because safety checks were
   missing in some functions. Also, the function `xmlParseEntityValue` didn't
   have any length limitation.
 * CVE-2022-40304: When a reference cycle is detected in the XML entity
   cleanup function the XML entity data can be stored in a dictionary. In this
   case, the dictionary becomes corrupted resulting in logic errors, including
   memory errors like double free.
