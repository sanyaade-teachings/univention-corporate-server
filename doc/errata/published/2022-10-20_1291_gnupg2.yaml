desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Fix CVE-2022-34903: GnuPG, in unusual situations where an attacker
   possesses any secret-key information from a victim's keyring and other
   constraints (e.g., use of GPGME) are met, allows signature forgery via
   injection into the status line.
 * Fix CVE-2018-9234: GnuPG does not enforce a configuration in which key
   certification requires an offline master Certify key, which results in
   apparently valid certifications that occurred only with access to a signing
   subkey.
