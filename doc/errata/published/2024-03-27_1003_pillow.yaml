fix: 5.4.1-2+deb10u5
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2022-22817: `PIL.ImageMath.eval` in Pillow before `9.0.0` allows
   evaluation of arbitrary expressions, such as ones that use the Python exec
   method. A lambda expression could also be used.
 * CVE-2021-23437: The package `pillow` `5.2.0` and before `8.3.2` are
 vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (`ReDoS`) via the `getrgb`
   function.
 * CVE-2023-44271: An issue was discovered in Pillow before `10.0.0`. It is
   a Denial of Service that uncontrollably allocates memory to process a
   given task, potentially causing a service to crash by having it run out of
   memory. This occurs for `truetype` in `ImageFont` when `textlength` in an
   `ImageDraw` instance operates on a long text argument.
