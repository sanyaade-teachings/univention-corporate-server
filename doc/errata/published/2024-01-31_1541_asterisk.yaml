desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2023-37457: The `update` functionality of the `PJSIP_HEADER`
   dialplan function can exceed the available buffer space for storing the
   new value of a header. By doing so this can overwrite memory or cause a
   crash. This is not externally exploitable, unless dialplan is explicitly
   written to update a header based on data from an outside source. If the
   `update` functionality is not used the vulnerability does not occur.
 * CVE-2023-49294: It is possible to read any arbitrary file even when the
   `live_dangerously` option is not enabled.
