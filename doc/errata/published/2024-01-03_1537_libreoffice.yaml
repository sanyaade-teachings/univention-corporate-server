 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2023-6185: An Improper Input Validation vulnerability was found in
   GStreamer integration of The Document Foundation LibreOffice allows an
   attacker to execute arbitrary GStreamer plugins. In affected versions the
   filename of the embedded video is not sufficiently escaped when passed to
   GStreamer enabling an attacker to run arbitrary gstreamer plugins depending
   on what plugins are installed on the target system.
 * CVE-2023-6186: LibreOffice supports hyperlinks. In addition to the
   typical common protocols such as http/https hyperlinks can also have target
   URLs that can launch built-in macros or dispatch built-in internal
   commands. In affected version of LibreOffice there are scenarios where
   these can be executed without warning if the user activates such
   hyperlinks. In later versions the users's explicit macro execution
   permissions for the document are now consulted if these non-typical
   hyperlinks can be executed. The possibility to use these variants of
   hyperlink targets for floating frames has been removed.
 * CVE-2020-12802: LibreOffice has a 'stealth mode' in which only
   documents from locations deemed 'trusted' are allowed to retrieve remote
   resources. This mode is not the default mode, but can be enabled by users
   who want to disable LibreOffice's ability to include remote resources
   within a document. A flaw existed where remote graphic links loaded from
   docx documents were omitted from this protection.
 * CVE-2020-12801: If LibreOffice has an encrypted document open and
   crashes, that document is auto-saved encrypted. On restart, LibreOffice
   offers to restore the document and prompts for the password to decrypt it.
   If the recovery is successful, and if the file format of the recovered
   document was not LibreOffice's default ODF file format, then affected
   versions of LibreOffice default that subsequent saves of the document are
   unencrypted. This may lead to a user accidentally saving a MSOffice file
   format document unencrypted while believing it to be encrypted.
 * CVE-2020-12803: ODF documents can contain forms to be filled out by the
   user. Similar to HTML forms, the contained form data can be submitted to a
   URI, for example, to an external web server. To create submittable forms,
   ODF implements the XForms W3C standard, which allows data to be submitted
   without the need for macros or other active scripting. LibreOffice allowed
   forms to be submitted to any URI, including file: URIs, enabling form
   submissions to overwrite local files. User-interaction is required to
   submit the form, but to avoid the possibility of malicious documents
   engineered to maximize the possibility of inadvertent user submission this
   feature has now been limited to http[s] URIs, removing the possibility to
   overwrite local files.
