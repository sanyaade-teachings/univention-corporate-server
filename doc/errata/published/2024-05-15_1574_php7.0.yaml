 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2024-2756: Due to an incomplete fix to CVE-2022-31629, network and
   same-site attackers can set a standard insecure cookie in the victim's
   browser which is treated as a `__Host-` or `__Secure-` cookie by `PHP`
   applications.
 * CVE-2024-3096: If a password stored with `password_hash` starts with a
   `null` byte (`\x00`), testing a blank string as the password via
   `password_verify()` will incorrectly return `true`.
