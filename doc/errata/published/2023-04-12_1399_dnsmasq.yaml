desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2017-15107: A vulnerability was found in the implementation of DNSSEC
   in Dnsmasq. Wildcard synthesized NSEC records could be improperly
   interpreted to prove the non-existence of hostnames that actually exist.
 * CVE-2019-14834: A memory leak allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
   service (memory consumption) via vectors involving DHCP response creation.
 * CVE-2022-0934: A single-byte, non-arbitrary write/use-after-free flaw was
   found in dnsmasq. This flaw allows an attacker who sends a crafted packet
   processed by dnsmasq, potentially causing a denial of service.
 * CVE-2023-28450: The default maximum EDNS.0 UDP packet size was set to 4096
   but should be 1232 because of DNS Flag Day 2020.
