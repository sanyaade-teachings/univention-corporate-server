desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2019-13115: integer overflow that could lead to an out-of-bounds read
   in the way packets are read from the server.
 * CVE-2019-17498: the `SSH_MSG_DISCONNECT` logic in `packet.c` has an integer
   overflow in a bounds check, enabling an attacker to specify an arbitrary
   (out-of-bounds) offset for a subsequent memory read.
 * CVE-2020-22218: missing check in `_libssh2_packet_add()` allows attackers
   to access out of bounds memory.
