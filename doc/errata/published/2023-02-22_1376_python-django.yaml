 This update addresses the following issue:
 * CVE-2023-23969: Prevent a potential Denial of Service vulnerability with
   pathological values for the Accept-Language header. The parsed values of
   Accept-Language headers are cached in order to avoid repetitive parsing.
   This could have led to a potential denial-of-service vector via excessive
   memory usage if the raw value of Accept-Language headers was very large.
   Accept-Language headers are now limited to a maximum length in order to
   avoid this issue.
