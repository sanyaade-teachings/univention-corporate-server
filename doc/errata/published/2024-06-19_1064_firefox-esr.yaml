desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2024-5702: Memory corruption in the networking stack could have led to
   a potentially exploitable crash.
 * CVE-2024-5688: If a garbage collection was triggered at the right time, a
   use-after-free could have occurred during object transplant.
 * CVE-2024-5690: By monitoring the time certain operations take, an attacker
   could have guessed which external protocol handlers were functional on a
   user's system.
 * CVE-2024-5691: By tricking the browser with a `X-Frame-Options` header, a
   sandboxed iframe could have presented a button that, if clicked by a user,
   would bypass restrictions to open a new window.
 * CVE-2024-5693: Offscreen Canvas did not properly track cross-origin
   tainting, which could be used to access image data from another site in
   violation of same-origin policy.
 * CVE-2024-5696: By manipulating the text in an `&lt;input&gt;` tag, an
   attacker could have caused corrupt memory leading to a potentially
   exploitable crash.
 * CVE-2024-5700: Memory safety bugs Some of these bugs showed evidence of
   memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these
   could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
