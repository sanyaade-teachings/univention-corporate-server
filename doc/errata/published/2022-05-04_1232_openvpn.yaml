desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * OpenVPN versions are vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability when
   key-method 1 is used, possibly resulting in code execution.
   (CVE-2017-12166)
 * An attacker can inject a data channel v2 (P_DATA_V2) packet using a
   victim's peer-id. Normally such packets are dropped, but if this packet
   arrives before the data channel crypto parameters have been initialized,
   the victim's connection will be dropped. This requires careful timing due
   to the small time window (usually within a few seconds) between the victim
   client connection starting and the server PUSH_REPLY response back to the
   client. This attack will only work if Negotiable Cipher Parameters (NCP) is
   in use. (CVE-2020-11810)
 * OpenVPN allows a remote attackers to bypass authentication and access
   control channel data on servers configured with deferred authentication,
   which can be used to potentially trigger further information leaks.
   (CVE-2020-15078)
 * OpenVPN may enable authentication bypass in external authentication
   plug-ins when more than one of them makes use of deferred authentication
   replies, which allows an external user to be granted access with only
   partially correct credentials. (CVE-2022-0547)
