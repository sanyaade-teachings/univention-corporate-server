desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2022-0204: a heap overflow vulnerability was found in bluez. An
   attacker with local network access could pass specially crafted files
   causing an application to halt or crash, leading to a denial of service.
 * CVE-2022-39176: BlueZ allows physically proximate attackers to obtain
   sensitive information because `profiles/audio/avrcp.c` does not validate
   `params_len`.
 * CVE-2022-39177: BlueZ allows physically proximate attackers to cause a
   denial of service because malformed and invalid capabilities can be
   processed in `profiles/audio/avdtp.c`.
