 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The new UCR variable `umc/cookie-banner/domains` can be used to configure
   on which domains to show the cookie banner. Additionally, top level domains
   can be configured so that the cookie can be shared between portal and login
   page. By default, both portal and login page will always show the cookie
   banner and not share it.
