 This update addresses the following issue:
 * A buffer overflow was discovered in NTFS-3G before 2022.10.3. Crafted
   metadata in an NTFS image can cause code execution. A local attacker can
   exploit this if the ntfs-3g binary is setuid root. A physically proximate
   attacker can exploit this if NTFS-3G software is configured to execute upon
   attachment of an external storage device. (CVE-2022-40284)
