 This update addresses the following issues:
 * LDAP-Attributes which are required by their schema are now marked as
   required in UMC.
 * Some performance optimizations during modification of user and group
   objects has been done.
 * The next free sambaRID is used when only a S4 Connector with IPv6 is part
   of the domain.
 * The error handling during creation of network objects with an invalid
   netmask has been improved.
 * A regression from erratum 115 in `univention.admin.objects.get()` has been
   fixed which caused that the Univention Corporate Client UMC configuration
   was not possible anymore.
