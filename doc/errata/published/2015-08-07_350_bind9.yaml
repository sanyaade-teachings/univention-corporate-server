version: [6]
desc: |
 The DNS server bind9 has been updated to the new release 9.8.4-P1 which
 is covered by security maintenance in Debian wheezy. It replaces the
 bind9 version 9.8.0-P4 distributed with previous releases of UCS 3.2.
 These vulnerabilities have been fixed in bind9:
 * Missing error handling in delegation handling could lead to denial
   of service against named (CVE-2014-8500).
 * Denial of service when DNSSEC validation and the managed-keys feature
   are enabled (CVE-2015-1349). Both not enabled in UCS by default.
 * Denial of service: crash in DNSSEC validation of specially crafted
   zone data (CVE-2015-4620). Not enabled in UCS by default.
 * An error in handling TKEY queries could be used to trigger a
   REQUIRE assertion failure leading to denial of service against
   named (CVE-2015-5477).
