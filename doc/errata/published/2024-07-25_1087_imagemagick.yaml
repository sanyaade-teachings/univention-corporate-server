desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2023-34151: A vulnerability was found in `ImageMagick`. This security
   flaw ouccers as an undefined behaviors of casting double to `size_t` in
   `svg`, `mvg` and other coders
 * CVE-2023-1289: A vulnerability was discovered in `ImageMagick` where a
   specially created `SVG` file loads itself and causes a segmentation fault.
   This flaw allows a remote attacker to pass a specially crafted `SVG` file
   that leads to a segmentation fault, generating many trash files in `/tmp,`
   resulting in a denial of service. These trash files can be large if the
   `SVG` file contains many render actions. In a denial of service attack, if
   a remote attacker uploads an `SVG` file of `size` t, `ImageMagick`
   generates files of size `103*t`. If an attacker uploads a `100M` `SVG`, the
   server will generate about `10G`.
