desc: |
 This updates the Linux kernel to version 4.9.189, which addresses (among
 others) the following security issues:
 * The print_binder_ref_olocked function in drivers/android/binder.c allows
   local users to obtain sensitive address information by reading " ref *desc
   *node" lines in a debugfs file. (CVE-2018-20509)
 * The print_binder_transaction_ilocked function in drivers/android/binder.c
   allows local users to obtain sensitive address information by reading
   "*from *code *flags" lines in a debugfs file. (CVE-2018-20510)
 * Insufficient access control in the IntelÂ® PROSet/Wireless WiFi Software
   driver may allow an unauthenticated user to potentially enable denial of
   service via adjacent access. (CVE-2019-0136)
 * The Bluetooth BR/EDR specification up to and including version 5.1 permits
   sufficiently low encryption key length and does not prevent an attacker
   from influencing the key length negotiation. This allows practical
   brute-force attacks (aka "KNOB") that can decrypt traffic and inject
   arbitrary ciphertext without the victim noticing. (CVE-2019-9506)
 * A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's freescale hypervisor manager
   implementation. A parameter passed to an ioctl was incorrectly validated
   and used in size calculations for the page size calculation. An attacker
   can use this flaw to crash the system, corrupt memory, or create other
   adverse security affects. (CVE-2019-10142)
 * The Linux kernel allows page->_refcount reference count overflow, with
   resultant use-after-free issues, if about 140 GiB of RAM exists. This is
   related to fs/fuse/dev.c, fs/pipe.c, fs/splice.c, include/linux/mm.h,
   include/linux/pipe_fs_i.h, kernel/trace/trace.c, mm/gup.c, and
   mm/hugetlb.c. It can occur with FUSE requests. (CVE-2019-11487)
 * There is a use-after-free caused by a malicious USB device in the
   drivers/media/v4l2-core/v4l2-dev.c driver because
   drivers/media/radio/radio-raremono.c does not properly allocate memory.
   (CVE-2019-15211)
 * There is a double-free caused by a malicious USB device in the
   drivers/usb/misc/rio500.c driver. (CVE-2019-15212)
 * There is a use-after-free caused by a malicious USB device in the
   drivers/media/usb/cpia2/cpia2_usb.c driver. (CVE-2019-15215)
 * There is a NULL pointer dereference caused by a malicious USB device in the
   drivers/usb/misc/yurex.c driver. (CVE-2019-15216)
 * There is a NULL pointer dereference caused by a malicious USB device in the
   drivers/media/usb/siano/smsusb.c driver. (CVE-2019-15218)
 * There is a NULL pointer dereference caused by a malicious USB device in the
   drivers/usb/misc/sisusbvga/sisusb.c driver. (CVE-2019-15219)
 * There is a use-after-free caused by a malicious USB device in the
   drivers/net/wireless/intersil/p54/p54usb.c driver. (CVE-2019-15220)
 * There is a NULL pointer dereference caused by a malicious USB device in the
   sound/usb/line6/pcm.c driver. (CVE-2019-15221)
 * There is a use-after-free in atalk_proc_exit, related to
   net/appletalk/atalk_proc.c, net/appletalk/ddp.c, and
   net/appletalk/sysctl_net_atalk.c. (CVE-2019-15292)
 * An issue was discovered in xfs_setattr_nonsize in fs/xfs/xfs_iops.c in the
   Linux kernel. XFS partially wedges when a chgrp fails on account of being
   out of disk quota. xfs_setattr_nonsize is failing to unlock the ILOCK after
   the xfs_qm_vop_chown_reserve call fails. This is primarily a local DoS
   attack vector, but it might result as well in remote DoS if the XFS
   filesystem is exported for instance via NFS. (CVE-2019-15538)
 * There is an out-of-bounds array access in __xfrm_policy_unlink, which will
   cause denial of service, because verify_newpolicy_info in
   net/xfrm/xfrm_user.c mishandles directory validation. (CVE-2019-15666)
 * In the Linux kernel there is a memory leak in
   drivers/scsi/libsas/sas_expander.c when SAS expander discovery fails. This
   will cause a BUG and denial of service. (CVE-2019-15807)
 * fm10k_init_module in drivers/net/ethernet/intel/fm10k/fm10k_main.c has a
   NULL pointer dereference because there is no -ENOMEM upon an
   alloc_workqueue failure. (CVE-2019-15924)
 * Out of bounds access exists in the functions
   ath6kl_wmi_pstream_timeout_event_rx and ath6kl_wmi_cac_event_rx in the file
   drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath6kl/wmi.c. (CVE-2019-15926)
