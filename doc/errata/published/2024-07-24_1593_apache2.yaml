desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2024-27316: `HTTP/2` incoming headers exceeding the limit were
   temporarily buffered in `nghttp2` in order to generate an informative HTTP
   `413` response. If a client does not stop sending headers, this leads to
   memory exhaustion.
 * CVE-2023-45802: When a `HTTP/2` stream was reset (`RST` frame) by a client,
   there was a time window were the request's memory resources were not
   reclaimed immediately. Instead, de-allocation was deferred to connection
   close. A client could send new requests and resets, keeping the connection
   busy and open and causing the memory footprint to keep on growing. On
   connection close, all resources were reclaimed, but the process might run
   out of memory before that.
 * CVE-2021-33193: A crafted method sent through `HTTP/2` will bypass
   validation and be forwarded by mod_proxy, which can lead to request
   splitting or cache poisoning
 * CVE-2020-11993: When `trace/debug` was enabled for the `HTTP/2` module and
   on certain traffic edge patterns, logging statements were made on the wrong
   connection, causing concurrent use of memory pool.
 * CVE-2020-9490: A specially crafted value for the 'Cache-Digest' header in a
   `HTTP/2` request would result in a crash when the server actually tries to
   `HTTP/2` PUSH a resource afterwards.
