desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2024-4367: A type check was missing when handling fonts in `PDF.js`,
   which would allow arbitrary JavaScript execution in the `PDF.js` context.
 * CVE-2024-4767: If the `browser.privatebrowsing.autostart` preference is
   enabled, `IndexedDB` files were not properly deleted when the window was
   closed. This preference is disabled by default in Firefox.
 * CVE-2024-4768: A bug in popup notifications' interaction with WebAuthn made
   it easier for an attacker to trick a user into granting permissions.
 * CVE-2024-4769: When importing resources using Web Workers, error messages
   would distinguish the difference between `application/javascript` responses
   and non-script responses. This could have been abused to learn information
   cross-origin.
 * CVE-2024-4770: When saving a page to PDF, certain font styles could have
   led to a potential use-after-free crash.
 * CVE-2024-4777: Memory safety bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and
   we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited
   to run arbitrary code.
