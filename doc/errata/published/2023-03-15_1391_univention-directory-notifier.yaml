desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Implement `univention-translog reinex` to re-built the transaction index
   file in case it gets corrupted. Univention Directory Notifier already has
   code to do maintain the index, but after certain error cases the index may
   become corrupt and has to be re-built. The code in UDN is not optimized to
   re-index many transactions in batch and shows performance issues for large
   transaction files.
