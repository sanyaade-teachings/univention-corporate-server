fix: 1:2.8+dfsg-6+deb9u19A~4.4.9.202403251158
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2023-2861: A flaw was found in the `9p passthrough filesystem`
   (`9pfs`) implementation in `QEMU`. The `9pfs` server did not prohibit
   opening special files on the host side, potentially allowing a malicious
   client to escape from the exported `9p` tree by creating and opening a
   device file in the shared folder.
 * CVE-2023-3354: A flaw was found in the `QEMU` built-in `VNC` server.
   When a client connects to the `VNC` server, `QEMU` checks whether the
   current number of connections crosses a certain threshold and if so,
   cleans up the previous connection. If the previous connection happens to
   be in the handshake phase and fails, `QEMU` cleans up the connection
   again, resulting in a `NULL` pointer dereference issue. This could allow a
   remote unauthenticated client to cause a denial of service.
 * CVE-2023-5088: A bug in `QEMU` could cause a guest I/O operation
   otherwise addressed to an arbitrary disk offset to be targeted to offset 0
   instead (potentially overwriting the VM's boot code). This could be used,
   for example, by `L2` guests with a virtual disk (`vdiskL2`) stored on a
   virtual disk of an `L1` (`vdiskL1`) hypervisor to read and/or write data
   to `LBA` 0 of `vdiskL1`, potentially gaining control of `L1` at its next
   reboot.
 * CVE-2020-14394: An infinite loop flaw was found in the USB `xHCI`
   controller emulation of `QEMU` while computing the length of the Transfer
   Request Block (`TRB`) Ring. This flaw allows a privileged guest user to
   hang the `QEMU` process on the host, resulting in a denial of service.
 * CVE-2023-0330: A vulnerability in the `lsi53c895a` device affects the
   latest version of `qemu`. A `DMA-MMIO` reentrancy problem may lead to
   memory corruption bugs like stack overflow or `use-after-free`.
 * CVE-2023-3180: A flaw was found in the `QEMU` virtual `crypto` device
   while handling data encryption/decryption requests in
   `virtio_crypto_handle_sym_req`. There is no check for the value of
   `src_len` and `dst_len` in `virtio_crypto_sym_op_helper`, potentially
   leading to a heap buffer overflow when the two values differ.
