fix: 232-25+deb9u16A~4.4.9.202308071430
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2023-26604: `systemd` does not adequately block local privilege
   escalation for some `Sudo` configurations, e.g., plausible `sudoers`
   files in which the `"systemctl status"` command may be executed.
   Specifically, `systemd` does not set `LESSSECURE` to 1, and thus other
   programs may be launched from the less program. This presents a
   substantial security risk when running `systemctl` from `Sudo`, because
   less executes as root when the terminal size is too small to show the
   complete `systemctl` output.
 * CVE-2022-3821: An off-by-one Error issue was discovered in `Systemd` in
   `format_timespan()` function of `time-util.c`. An attacker could supply
   specific values for time and accuracy that leads to buffer overrun in
   `format_timespan()`, leading to a Denial of Service.
