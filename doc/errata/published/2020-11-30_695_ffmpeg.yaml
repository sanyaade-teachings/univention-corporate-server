fix: 7:3.2.15-0+deb9u1
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * In FFmpeg 4.1.3, there is a division by zero at `adx_write_trailer` in
   `libavformat/rawenc.c.` (CVE-2019-13390)
 * FFmpeg before 4.2 has a heap-based buffer overflow in `vqa_decode_chunk`
   because of an out-of-array access in vqa_decode_init in
   `libavcodec/vqavideo.c.` (CVE-2019-17542)
 * FFmpeg 4.2.3 has a use-after-free via a crafted EXTINF duration in an m3u8
   file because `parse_playlist` in `libavformat/hls.c` frees a pointer, and
   later that pointer is accessed in `av_probe_input_format3` in
   `libavformat/format.c`. (CVE-2020-13904)
