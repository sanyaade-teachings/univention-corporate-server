desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 3.0.17+dfsg-1.1+deb9u1 (Fri, 24 Feb 2023 14:19:28 +0100)
 * Non-maintainer upload by the ELTS team.
 * CVE-2022-41859: In freeradius, the EAP-PWD function
   compute_password_element() leaks information about the password which
   allows an attacker to substantially reduce the size of an offline
   dictionary attack.
 * CVE-2022-41860: In freeradius, when an EAP-SIM supplicant sends an unknown
   SIM option, the server will try to look that option up in the internal
   dictionaries. This lookup will fail, but the SIM code will not check for
   that failure. Instead, it will dereference a NULL pointer, and cause the
   server to crash.
 * CVE-2022-41861: A flaw was found in freeradius. A malicious RADIUS client
   or home server can send a malformed attribute which can cause the server to
   crash.
 * CVE-2019-11234: FreeRADIUS does not prevent use of reflection for
   authentication spoofing, aka a "Dragonblood" issue, a similar issue to
   CVE-2019-9497.
 * CVE-2019-11235: FreeRADIUS mishandles the "each participant verifies that
   the received scalar is within a range, and that the received group element
   is a valid point on the curve being used" protection mechanism, aka a
   "Dragonblood" issue, a similar issue to CVE-2019-9498 and CVE-2019-9499.
 * CVE-2019-13456: In FreeRADIUS 3.0 on average 1 in every 2048 EAP-pwd
   handshakes fails because the password element cannot be found within 10
   iterations of the hunting and pecking loop. This leaks information that an
   attacker can use to recover the password of any user. This information
   leakage is similar to the "Dragonblood" attack and CVE-2019-9494.
 * CVE-2019-17185: In FreeRADIUS 3.0.x the EAP-pwd module used a global
   OpenSSL BN_CTX instance to handle all handshakes. This mean multiple
   threads use the same BN_CTX instance concurrently, resulting in crashes
   when concurrent EAP-pwd handshakes are initiated. This can be abused by an
   adversary as a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.
 3.0.17+dfsg-1.1+deb10u1 (Sat, 27 Aug 2022 22:29:38 +0300)
 * Non-maintainer upload.
 * CVE-2019-13456: side-channel leak where 1 in 2048 handshakes fail
 * CVE-2019-17185: DoS due to multithreaded BN_CTX access
 * Add upstream fix for a crash bug.

 * Cherry-Pick upstream commits to fix CVE-2019-11234 / CVE-2019-11235 /
   VU#871675 (Invalid Curve Attack and Reflection Attack on EAP-PWD, leading
   to authentication bypass)
