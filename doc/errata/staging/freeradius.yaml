desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2019-11234: FreeRADIUS does not prevent use of reflection for
   authentication spoofing, aka a "Dragonblood" issue, a similar issue to
   CVE-2019-9497.
 * CVE-2019-11235: FreeRADIUS mishandles the "each participant verifies that
   the received scalar is within a range, and that the received group element
   is a valid point on the curve being used" protection mechanism, aka a
   "Dragonblood" issue, a similar issue to CVE-2019-9498 and CVE-2019-9499.
 * CVE-2019-13456: In average 1 in every 2048 EAP-pwd handshakes fails because
   the password element cannot be found within 10 iterations of the hunting
   and pecking loop. This leaks information that an attacker can use to
   recover the password of any user. This information leakage is similar to
   the "Dragonblood" attack and CVE-2019-9494.
 * CVE-2019-17185: the EAP-pwd module used a global OpenSSL `BN_CTX` instance
   to handle all handshakes. This mean multiple threads use the same `BN_CTX`
   instance concurrently, resulting in crashes when concurrent EAP-pwd
   handshakes are initiated. This can be abused by an adversary as a
   Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.
 * CVE-2022-41859: the EAP-PWD function `compute_password_element()` leaks
   information about the password which allows an attacker to substantially
   reduce the size of an offline dictionary attack.
 * CVE-2022-41860: when an EAP-SIM supplicant sends an unknown SIM option, the
   server will try to look that option up in the internal dictionaries. This
   lookup will fail, but the SIM code will not check for that failure.
   Instead, it will dereference a NULL pointer, and cause the server to crash.
 * CVE-2022-41861: A malicious RADIUS client or home server can send a
   malformed attribute which can cause the server to crash.
