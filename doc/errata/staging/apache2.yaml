desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2019-17567: Apache HTTP Server `mod_proxy_wstunnel` configured on an
   URL that is not necessarily Upgraded by the origin server was tunneling the
   whole connection regardless, thus allowing for subsequent requests on the
   same connection to pass through with no HTTP validation, authentication or
   authorization possibly configured.
 * CVE-2023-31122: Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability in `mod_macro` of Apache
   HTTP Server.
 * CVE-2023-38709: Faulty input validation in the core of Apache allows
   malicious or exploitable backend/content generators to split HTTP
   responses.
 * CVE-2023-45802: When a HTTP/2 stream was reset (`RST frame`) by a client,
   there was a time window were the request's memory resources were not
   reclaimed immediately. Instead, de-allocation was deferred to connection
   close. A client could send new requests and resets, keeping the connection
   busy and open and causing the memory footprint to keep on growing. On
   connection close, all resources were reclaimed, but the process might run
   out of memory before that.
 * CVE-2024-24795: HTTP Response splitting in multiple modules in Apache HTTP
   Server allows an attacker that can inject malicious response headers into
   backend applications to cause an HTTP desynchronization attack.
 * CVE-2024-27316: HTTP/2 incoming headers exceeding the limit are temporarily
   buffered in ´nghttp2´ in order to generate an informative HTTP `413`
   response. If a client does not stop sending headers, this leads to memory
   exhaustion.
