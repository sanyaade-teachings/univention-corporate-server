desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Enhance LDAP overlay `slapd-sock` by adding
   `extendedresults` as a possible value to the
   `sockresps` configuration option. With that
   configuration, the overlay outputs a change
   ldif in the RESULT phase, including LDAPControl
   data for `PostReadControl` and `PreReadControl`
   collected during CRUD operations. The output
   format is similar to the one used by the LDAP
   overlay `auditlog` with an additional `control:`
   field.
