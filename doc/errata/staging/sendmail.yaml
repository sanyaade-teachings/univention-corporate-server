 This update addresses the following issue:
 8.15.2-8+deb9u2 (Sun, 24 Mar 2024 22:52:56 +0000)
 * ELTS Team upload
 * Fix CVE-2023-51765: sendmail allowed SMTP smuggling in certain
   configurations. Remote attackers can use a published exploitation technique
   to inject e-mail messages with a spoofed MAIL FROM address, allowing bypass
   of an SPF protection mechanism. This occurs because sendmail supports
   <LF>.<CR><LF> but some other popular e-mail servers do not. This is
   resolved with 'o' in srv_features.
 * Enable _FFR_REJECT_NUL_BYTE for rejecting mail that include NUL byte
