 This update addresses the following issues:
 * A vulnerability in the OOXML parsing module in Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV)
   Software version 0.104.1 and LTS version 0.103.4 and prior versions could
   allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service
   condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper
   checks that may result in an invalid pointer read. An attacker could
   exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted OOXML file to an affected
   device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning
   process to crash, resulting in a denial of service condition.
