 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2023-6597: An issue was found in the `CPython`
   `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` class. The `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory`
   class would dereference symlinks during cleanup of `permissions-related`
   errors. This means users which can run privileged programs are potentially
   able to modify permissions of files referenced by symlinks in some
   circumstances.
 * CVE-2024-0450: An issue was found in the `CPython` `zipfile` module The
   zipfile module is vulnerable to `quoted-overlap` `zip-bombs` which exploit
   the zip format to create a `zip-bomb` with a high compression ratio. The
   fixed versions of `CPython` makes the `zipfile` module reject zip archives
   which overlap entries in the archive.
