 * Non-maintainer upload by the LTS Security Team.
 * Fix CVE-2024-2756: Due to an incomplete fix to CVE-2022-31629, network and
   same-site attackers can set a standard insecure cookie in the victim's
   browser which is treated as a __Host- or __Secure- cookie by PHP
   applications.
 * Fix CVE-2024-3096: If a password stored with password_hash starts with a
   null byte (\x00), testing a blank string as the password via
   password_verify() will incorrectly return true.
 * d/p/CVE-2023-3823.patch: Also backport upstream commit 62228a25685 (a no-op
   on Linux.)
