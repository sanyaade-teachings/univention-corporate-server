desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2024-2756: Due to an incomplete fix to CVE-2022-31629, network and
   same-site attackers can set a standard insecure cookie in the victim's
   browser which is treated as a `__Host-` or `__Secure-` cookie by `PHP`
   applications.
 * CVE-2024-3096: If a password stored with `password_hash` starts with a
   `null` byte (`\x00`), testing a blank string as the password via
   `password_verify()` will incorrectly return `true`.
 * CVE-2023-3823: Various `XML` functions rely on `libxml` global state to
   track configuration variables, like whether external entities are loaded.
   This state is assumed to be unchanged unless the user explicitly changes it
   by calling appropriate function. However, since the state is
   process-global, other modules - such as `ImageMagick` - may also use this
   library within the same process, and change that global state for their
   internal purposes, and leave it in a state where external entities loading
   is enabled. This can lead to the situation where external `XML` is parsed
   with external entities loaded, which can lead to disclosure of any local
   files accessible to `PHP`. This vulnerable state may persist in the same
   process across many requests, until the process is shut down.
