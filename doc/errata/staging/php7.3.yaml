 * Fix CVE-2024-5458: Due to a code logic error, filtering functions such as
   filter_var when validating URLs (FILTER_VALIDATE_URL) for certain types of
   URLs the function will result in invalid user information (username +
   password part of URLs) being treated as valid user information. This may

   them incorrectly. The problem is related to CVE-2020-7071, but affects IPv6
