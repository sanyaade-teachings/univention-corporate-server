 [ Chris Lamb ]
 * Non-maintainer upload by the Debian ELTS team.
 * Update tests now that urllib.parse in python3-six has been changed to strip
   ASCII newlines and tabs.
 * CVE-2023-36053: Prevent a potential regular expression denial of service
   (DoS) vulnerability in EmailValidator and URLValidator. EmailValidator and
   URLValidator were subject to potential regular expression denial of service
   attack via a very large number of domain name labels of emails and URLs.

 * CVE-2023-43665: Fix a DoS vulnuerability in django.utils.text.Truncator.
   Following the fix for CVE-2019-14232, the regular expressions used in the
   implementation of django.utils.text.Truncatorâ€™s chars() and words() methods
   were revised and improved. However, these regular expressions still
   exhibited linear backtracking complexity, so when given a very long,
   potentially malformed HTML input, the evaluation would still be slow,
   leading to a potential denial of service vulnerability.
 * CVE-2024-24680: Prevent a potential DoS in the intcomma template filter.
   The intcomma template filter was subject to a potential denial-of-service
   attack when used with very long strings.
