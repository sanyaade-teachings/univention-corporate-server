 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2023-36053: Prevent a potential regular expression denial of service
   (DoS) vulnerability in `EmailValidator` and `URLValidator`.
   `EmailValidator` and `URLValidator` were subject to potential regular
   expression denial of service attack via a very large number of domain name
   labels of emails and URLs.
 * CVE-2024-24680: Prevent a potential DoS in the intcomma template filter.
   The `intcomma` template filter was subject to a potential denial-of-service
   attack when used with very long strings.
 * CVE-2023-43665: Potential DoS (denial of service) attack via certain inputs
   with very long, potentially malformed HTML text. The `chars()` and
   `words()` methods are used to implement the `truncatechars_html` and
   `truncatewords_html` template filters, which are thus also vulnerable.
