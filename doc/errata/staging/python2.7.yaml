 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2015-20107: the mailcap module does not add escape characters into
   commands discovered in the system mailcap file. This may allow attackers to
   inject shell commands into applications that call mailcap.findmatch with
   untrusted input (if they lack validation of user-provided filenames or
   arguments).
 * CVE-2020-8492: Python allows an HTTP server to conduct Regular Expression
   Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks against a client because of
   urllib.request.AbstractBasicAuthHandler catastrophic backtracking.
 * CVE-2020-26116: http.client allows CRLF injection if the attacker controls
   the HTTP request method, as demonstrated by inserting CR and LF control
   characters in the first argument of HTTPConnection.request.
 * CVE-2021-3733: There's a flaw in urllib's AbstractBasicAuthHandler class.
   An attacker who controls a malicious HTTP server that an HTTP client (such
   as web browser) connects to, could trigger a Regular Expression Denial of
   Service (ReDOS) during an authentication request with a specially crafted
   payload that is sent by the server to the client.
 * CVE-2021-3737: An improperly handled HTTP response in the HTTP client code
   of python may allow a remote attacker, who controls the HTTP server, to
   make the client script enter an infinite loop, consuming CPU time.
 * CVE-2022-45061: An unnecessary quadratic algorithm exists in one path when
   processing some inputs to the IDNA (RFC 3490) decoder, such that a crafted,
   unreasonably long name being presented to the decoder could lead to a CPU
   denial of service.
