 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2023-48795: The `SSH` transport protocol, along with certain OpenSSH
   extensions contains a vulnerability termed `Terrapin` attack. This flaw
   allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks, leading to the omission
   of certain packets during extension negotiation. Consequently, a connection
   may be established with downgraded or disabled security features. The
   vulnerability arises due to mishandling of the handshake phase and sequence
   numbers within the `SSH` Binary Packet Protocol (`BPP`) by these
   extensions. Specifically, it affects SSH's usage of `ChaCha20-Poly1305` and
   `CBC` with `Encrypt-then-MAC` algorithms.
 * CVE-2023-51385: Ban most shell metacharacters from user and hostnames
   supplied via the command-line
 * CVE-2021-41617: Initialise correctly supplemental groups when executing an
   `AuthorizedKeysCommand` or `AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand`
