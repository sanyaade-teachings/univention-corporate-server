desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2017-18028: A memory exhaustion vulnerability was found in the function
   `ReadTIFFImage` in `coders/tiff.c`, which allow remote attackers to cause a
   denial of service via a crafted file.
 * CVE-2018-16644: Use correct exception handling to check for length in the
   functions `ReadDCMImage` of `coders/dcm.c` and `ReadPICTImage` of
   `coders/pict.c`, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
   via a crafted image.
 * CVE-2021-3574: A memory leaks was found when executing command `convert`.
 * CVE-2021-20224: An integer overflow issue was discovered in ImageMagick's
   function `ExportIndexQuantum()` in `MagickCore/quantum-export.c`. Function
   calls to `GetPixelIndex()` could result in values outside the range of
   representable for the 'unsigned char'. When ImageMagick processes a crafted
   pdf file, this could lead to an undefined behaviour or a crash.
 * CVE-2022-44267: Denial-of-service when it parses a PNG image.
 * CVE-2020-27767: Outside the range of representable values of type 'float'
