 * Upload by ELTS Security Team.
 * Fix an out of bound acess in TIFF coder.
 * Fix a heap based overflow in TIFF coder.
 * Avoid a DOS with malformed TIFF file.
 * Avoid a memory leak in TIFF file coder.
 * Fix a non initialized value passed to TIFFGetField().
 * Fix buffer overrun in TIFF coder.
 * In case of exception bail out early in TIFF file handling.
 * Fix unintialised value in TIFF coder.
 * Raise exception when image could not be read but no exception was raised in
   TIFF coder.
 * Fix an improper header problem in TIFF coder.
 * Fix a stack overflow in _TIFFVGetField.
 * Fix a Stack-buffer-overflow WRITE 4.
 * Fix a few buffer overrun in TIFF coder.
 * Fix an unintialised value in TIFF coder.
 * Raise exception when image could not be read but no exception was raised.
 * Fix CVE-2023-5341: A heap use-after-free flaw was found in coders/bmp.c
 * Fix CVE-2023-34151: properly cast double to size_t.
 .
 * Fix CVE-2023-1289: A vulnerability was discovered where a specially created
   SVG file loads itself and causes a segmentation fault. This flaw allows a
   remote attacker to pass a specially crafted SVG file that leads to a
   segmentation fault, generating many trash files in "/tmp," resulting in a
   denial of service. When ImageMagick crashes, it generates a lot of trash
   files. These trash files can be large if the SVG file contains many render
   actions
 * Fix CVE-2022-48541: A memory leak allowed remote attackers to perform a
   denial of service via the "identify -help" command.
 * Fix CVE-2017-11752: The ReadMAGICKImage function allows remote attackers to
   cause a denial of service (memory leak) via a crafted file.
 * Fix CVE-2017-12566: A memory leak vulnerability was found in the function
   ReadMVGImage in coders/mvg.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of
   service, related to the function ReadSVGImage in svg.c.
 * Fix CVE-2017-18022: Memory leaks were found in MontageImageCommand in
   MagickWand/montage.c.
 * Fix CVE-2018-11655: a memory leak vulnerability was found in the function
   GetImagePixelCache in MagickCore/cache.c, which allows attackers to cause a
   denial of service via a crafted CALS image file
