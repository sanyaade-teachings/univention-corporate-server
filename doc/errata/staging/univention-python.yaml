 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Add new UCR varable `directory/manager/feature/prepostread`
   to configure `univention.uldap` to send LDAPControls
   `PostReadControl` and `PreReadControl` for CRUD operations
   (`add`, `modify`, `modrdn`, `delete`). If this option
   is activated the LDAPControls will instruct OpenLDAP to
   return all regular and operational attributes the are
   readable by the binddn before and after the change.
