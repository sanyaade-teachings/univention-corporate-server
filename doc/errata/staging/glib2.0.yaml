 This update addresses the following issue:
 2.58.3-2+deb10u6 (Fri, 10 May 2024 15:33:34 +0100)
 * d/patches: Backport GDBus fixes from 2.80.1, 2.80.2 - If local users send
   signals on the D-Bus system bus that spoof a trusted sender, do not deliver
   them to signal subscriptions for the trusted sender's well-known bus name
   (CVE-2024-34397) - Fix a use-after-free when subscribing to signals with an
   arg0 match rule, originally from 2.79.0 and necessary to make the test for
   CVE-2024-34397 pass reliably - Add a local backport of g_set_str(),
   required by the above - Relax name owner checks to avoid a regression in
   ibus (avoids: #1070730, etc.)
 * d/p/gdbusmessage-Clean-the-cached-arg0-when-setting-the-messa.patch: Add
   patch from upstream fixing a memory leak that can occur in rare situations
   with the above changes (avoids: #1070851)
bug: [57300]
