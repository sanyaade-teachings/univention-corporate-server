 This update addresses the following issue:
 * CVE-2024-34397: When a `GDBus-based` client subscribes to signals from a
   trusted system service such as NetworkManager on a shared computer, other
   users of the same computer can send spoofed D-Bus signals that the
   `GDBus-based` client will wrongly interpret as having been sent by the
   trusted system service. This could lead to the `GDBus-based` client
   behaving incorrectly, with an application-dependent impact.
