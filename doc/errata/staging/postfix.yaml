 * Fix CVE-2023-51764: Postfix allowed SMTP smuggling unless configured with
   smtpd_data_restrictions=reject_unauth_pipelining and
   smtpd_discard_ehlo_keywords=chunking. Remote attackers can use a published
   exploitation technique to inject e-mail messages with a spoofed MAIL FROM
   address, allowing bypass of an SPF protection mechanism.
