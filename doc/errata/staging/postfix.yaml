 This update addresses the following issue:
 * CVE-2023-51764: Postfix allowed `SMTP` smuggling unless configured with
   `smtpd_data_restrictions=reject_unauth_pipelining` and
   `smtpd_discard_ehlo_keywords=chunking`. Remote attackers can use a
   published exploitation technique to inject e-mail messages with a spoofed
   `MAIL FROM` address, allowing bypass of an `SPF` protection mechanism.
