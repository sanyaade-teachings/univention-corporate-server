  This update addresses the following issues:
  * When objects where changed in Microsoft Active Directory, the AD-Connector
    checked if the object should be ignored. The decision is based on three
    criteria, `match_filter`, `ignoresubtree` and the `ignorelist` from which the
    `ignore_filter` is constructed. Since Bug 37351 has been fixed in `errata4.0-1`
    this check is not only applied to the new object, but also to the object existing
    in UDM, which represents the old state at the time of sync.
    In scenarios where an object is present in UDM and Microsoft Active Directory but
    matches the `ignore_filter` this had the negative side effect, that the AD object
    would still be ignored even if the administrator changed an attribute in a way
    that the new object did not match the `ignore_filter` any longer. This affected
    user objects.
    This problem has been fixed by restricting the change for Bug 37351 to apply
    only to objects matching the criteria of a `windowscomputer`, as these don't
    have an `ignore_filter`.
