version: [8]
scope: ucs_5.0-0-errata5.0-8

fix: 14.0.19-4
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The connector can now be configured to only synchronize objects
   from specific subtrees via the newly added UCR variables
   `connector/ad/mapping/allowsubtree/$NAME/ucs` and
   `connector/ad/mapping/allowsubtree/$NAME/ad`. `$NAME` is an
   arbitrary string, the value for the `ucs` variable is a subtree
   LDAP DN in the UCS directory and the value for the `ad` variable
   is a subtree LDAP DN of the AD directory. Both must include the
   LDAP base of the respective directory. If configured only objects
   from these subtrees are synchronized, everything else is ignored.
 * The connector can now be configured to only synchronize objects
   that match a specific LDAP filter. For each object type in
   `user`, `group`, `container`, `ou` and `windowscomputer` the UCR
   variable `connector/ad/mapping/{object type}/allowfilter` can
   be used to configure this LDAP filter.
 * SQLite databases used by the AD Connector were world readable in certain
   cases. This has been changed.
