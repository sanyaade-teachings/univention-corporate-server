fix: 14.0.16-5
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * During synchonization from an MS AD forest child domain, the connector
   may receive DNs that refer to objects outside the scope of the child
   domain. In that case it receives an LDAP referral which caused a python
   traceback. The AD-Connector now skips referrals to objects and logs
   an informative message instead.
