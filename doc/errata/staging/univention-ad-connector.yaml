fix: 14.0.19-2
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The connector can now be configured to only synchronize objects
   from specific subtrees via the newly added UCR variables
   `connector/ad/mapping/allowsubtree/$NAME/ucs` and
   `connector/ad/mapping/allowsubtree/$NAME/ad`. `$NAME` is an
   arbitrary string, the value for the `ucs` variable is a subtree
   LDAP DN in the UCS directory and the value for the `ad` variable
   is a subtree LDAP DN of the AD directory. Both must include the
   LDAP base of the respective directory. If configured only objects
   from these subtrees are synchronized, everything else is ignored.
