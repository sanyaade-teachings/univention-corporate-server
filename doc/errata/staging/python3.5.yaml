 This update addresses the following issues:

 Debian update 3.5.3-1+deb9u8
 3.5.3-1+deb9u8 (Wed, 01 Nov 2023 18:03:23 +0000)
 * Non-maintainer upload by the ELTS Security Team.
 * Fix a regression in CVE-2021-3177: ISO C90 forbids mixed declarations and
   code [-Werror=declaration-after-statement]
 * Fix CVE-2022-48560: A use-after-free exists in Python via heappushpop in
   heapq.
 * Backport GH-4455 needed for fixing CVE-2022-4856[4-5].
 * Fix CVE-2022-48564: DoS attack via CPU and RAM exhaustion when processing
   malformed Apple Property List files in binary format.
 * Fix CVE-2022-48565: An XML External Entity (XXE) issue was discovered in
   Python. The plistlib module no longer accepts entity declarations in XML
   plist files to avoid XML vulnerabilities.
 * CVE-2022-48566: An issue was discovered in compare_digest in Lib/hmac.py in
   Python. Constant-time-defeating optimisations were possible in the
   accumulator variable in hmac.compare_digest, that would facilitate a side
   channel type attack.
 * CVE-2023-40217: Fix a race condition in TLS handling. If a TLS server-side
   socket is created, receives data into the socket buffer, and then is closed
   quickly, there is a brief window where the SSLSocket instance will detect
   the socket as "not connected" and won't initiate a handshake, but buffered
   data will still be readable from the socket buffer. This data will not be
   authenticated if the server-side TLS peer is expecting client certificate
   authentication, and is indistinguishable from valid TLS stream data. Data
   is limited in size to the amount that will fit in the buffer. The TLS
   connection cannot directly be used for data exfiltration because the
   vulnerable code path requires that the connection be closed on
   initialization of the SSLSocket
 * Fix testsuite: - depends on netbase - refresh certificate - backport
   bpo-38275: skip ssl test if not supported by libssl - backport bpo-34399:
   DH keys are now 3072bits - avoid test that fail due to eatmydata - avoid
   test that fail due to hardenning libexpat
