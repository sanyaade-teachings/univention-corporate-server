 This update addresses the following issue:
 * Fix CVE-2021-46822: The PPM reader in libjpeg-turbo mishandles use of
   `tjLoadImage` for loading a 16-bit binary PPM file into a grayscale buffer
   and loading a 16-bit binary PGM file into an RGB buffer. This is related to
   a heap-based buffer overflow in the function `get_word_rgb_row` in
   `rdppm.c`.
