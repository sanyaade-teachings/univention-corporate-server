desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 2.21.0-1+deb10u1 (Sun, 18 Jun 2023 00:29:17 +0200)
 * Non-maintainer upload by the LTS team.
 * Fix CVE-2023-32681: Requests has been leaking Proxy-Authorization headers
   to destination servers when redirected to an HTTPS endpoint. For HTTP
   connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in
   the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination
   server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must
   be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the
   tunneled request. This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to
   the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to
   potentially exfiltrate sensitive information.
