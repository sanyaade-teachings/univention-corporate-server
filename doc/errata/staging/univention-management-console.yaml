 This update addresses the following issues:
 * User preferences (such as favorite UMC modules) could not be set via old
   UMC clients from UCS systems <= UCS 5.0-3. The functionality has been
   restored.
 * Explicit defaults for cookie settings were added to
   `/var/www/univention/meta.json` so they are available for all
   components that needs them.
