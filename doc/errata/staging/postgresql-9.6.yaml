 This update addresses the following issues:

 Debian update 9.6.24-0+deb9u2
 9.6.24-0+deb9u2 (Wed, 23 Nov 2022 13:36:58 -0500)
 * Non-maintainer upload by the ELTS Team.
 * CVE-2022-1552: There is an issue with incomplete efforts to operate safely
   when a privileged user is maintaining another user's objects. The
   Autovacuum, REINDEX, CREATE INDEX, REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW, CLUSTER, and
   pg_amcheck commands activated relevant protections too late or not at all
   during the process. This flaw allows an attacker with permission to create
   non-temporary objects in at least one schema to execute arbitrary SQL
   functions under a superuser identity.
 * CVE-2022-2625: This attack requires permission to create non-temporary
   objects in at least one schema, the ability to lure or wait for an
   administrator to create or update an affected extension in that schema, and
   the ability to lure or wait for a victim to use the object targeted in
   CREATE OR REPLACE or CREATE IF NOT EXISTS. Given all three prerequisites,
   this flaw allows an attacker to run arbitrary code as the victim role,
   which may be a superuser.

 Debian update 9.6.24-0+deb9u3
 9.6.24-0+deb9u3 (Sat, 26 Nov 2022 13:08:33 -0500)
 * debian/rules: set locale to "C" and pass --no-locale option to regression
   test suite so that ELTS build host default locale does not cause spurious
   test failure.
