 This update addresses the following issues:

 Debian update 9.6.24-0+deb9u5
 9.6.24-0+deb9u5 (Tue, 14 Nov 2023 19:18:16 +0100)
 * Non-maintainer upload by the ELTS team.
 * Fix CVE-2023-5868: Certain aggregate function calls receiving
   "unknown"-type arguments could disclose bytes of server memory from the end
   of the "unknown"-type value to the next zero byte. One typically gets an
   "unknown"-type value via a string literal having no type designation.
 * Fix CVE-2023-5869: While modifying certain SQL array values, missing
   overflow checks let authenticated database users write arbitrary bytes to a
   memory area that facilitates arbitrary code execution. Missing overflow
   checks also let authenticated database users read a wide area of server
   memory. The CVE-2021-32027 fix covered some attacks of this description,
   but it missed others.
 * Fix CVE-2023-5870: Documentation says the pg_signal_backend role cannot
   signal "a backend owned by a superuser". On the contrary, it can signal
   background workers, including the logical replication launcher. It can
   signal autovacuum workers and the autovacuum launcher. Signaling autovacuum
   workers and those two launchers provides no meaningful exploit, so
   exploiting this vulnerability requires a non-core extension with a
   less-resilient background worker. For example, a non-core background worker
   that does not auto-restart would experience a denial of service with
   respect to that particular background worker.
 * Fix CVE-2023-39417: In the EXTENSION SCRIPT, a SQL Injection vulnerability
   was found in PostgreSQL if it uses @extowner@, @extschema@, or
   @extschema:...@ inside a quoting construct (dollar quoting, '', or ""). If
   an administrator has installed files of a vulnerable, trusted, non-bundled
   extension, an attacker with database-level CREATE privilege can execute
   arbitrary code as the bootstrap superuser.
