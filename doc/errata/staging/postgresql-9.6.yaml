 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2023-2454: schema_element defeats protective search_path changes;
   It was found that certain database calls in PostgreSQL could permit an
   attacker with elevated database-level privileges to execute arbitrary code.
 * CVE-2023-2455: Row security policies disregard user ID changes after
   inlining; PostgreSQL could permit incorrect policies to be applied in
   certain cases where role-specific policies are used and a given query is
   planned under one role and then executed under other roles.
