fix: 7.52.1-5+deb9u22
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * A denial-of-service vulnerability was found in cURL. libcurl's ASN.1 parser
   has the `GTime2str()` function, used for parsing an ASN.1 Generalized Time
   field. If given a syntactically incorrect field, the parser might end up
   crashing but this flaw can also lead to heap contents getting returned to
   the application when `CURLINFO_CERTINFO` is used (CVE-2024-7264).

- CVE-2024-7264
