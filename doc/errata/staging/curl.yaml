   the read callback (`CURLOPT_READFUNCTION`) to ask for data to send, even
   when the option `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS` has been set, if the same handle
   previously was used to issue a PUT request which used that callback.
 * CVE-2022-35252: When curl is used to retrieve and parse cookies from a
   HTTP(S) server, it accepts cookies using control codes that when later are
   sent back to a HTTP server might make the server return 400 responses.
   Effectively allowing a "sister site" to deny service to all siblings.
