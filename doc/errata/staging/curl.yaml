 This update addresses the following issue:
 * CVE-2024-7264: A denial-of-service vulnerability was found in cURL, an
   easy-to-use client-side URL transfer library. libcurl's ASN1 parser code
   has the GTime2str() function, used for parsing an ASN.1 Generalized Time
   field. If given an syntactically incorrect field, the parser might end up
   crashing but this flaw can also lead to heap contents getting returned to
   the application when CURLINFO_CERTINFO is used.
