 This update addresses the following issue:
 7.64.0-4+deb10u9 (Sun, 28 Jan 2024 21:15:21 +0000)
 * Non-maintainer upload by the LTS Team.
 * CVE-2023-27534: A path traversal vulnerability existed. SFTP implementation
   causes the tilde (~) character to be wrongly replaced when used as a prefix
   in the first path element, in addition to its intended use as the first
   element to indicate a path relative to the user's home directory. Attackers
   can exploit this flaw to bypass filtering or execute arbitrary code by
   crafting a path like /~2/foo while accessing a server with a specific user.
