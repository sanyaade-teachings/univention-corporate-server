 This update addresses the following issues:
 7.52.1-5+deb9u17 (Sat, 20 Aug 2022 15:37:57 +0200)
 * Non-maintainer upload by the ELTS team.
 * Fix CVE-2022-22576: An improper authentication vulnerability exists in curl
   which might allow reuse OAUTH2-authenticated connections without properly
   making sure that the connection was authenticated with the same credentials
   as set for this transfer. This affects SASL-enabled protocols: SMPTP(S),
   IMAP(S), POP3(S) and LDAP(S) (openldap only).
 * Fix CVE-2022-27776: A insufficiently protected credentials vulnerability in
   curl might leak authentication or cookie header data on HTTP redirects to
   the same host but another port number.
 * Fix CVE-2022-27781: libcurl provides the `CURLOPT_CERTINFO` option to allow
   applications to request details to be returned about a server's certificate
   chain. Due to an erroneous function, a malicious server could make libcurl
   built withNSS get stuck in a never-ending busy-loop when trying to retrieve
   thatinformation.
 * Fix CVE-2022-27782: libcurl would reuse a previously created connection
   even when a TLS or SSH related option had been changed that should have
   prohibited reuse. libcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection
   pool for subsequent transfers to reuse if one of them matches the setup.
   However, several TLS and SSH settings were left out from the configuration
   match checks, making them match too easily.
 * Fix CVE-2022-32208: When curl < 7.84.0 does FTP transfers secured by krb5,
   it handles message verification failures wrongly. This flaw makes it
   possible for a Man-In-The-Middle attack to go unnoticed and even allows it
   to inject data to the client.
