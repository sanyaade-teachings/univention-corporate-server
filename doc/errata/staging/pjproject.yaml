 This update addresses the following issues:
 * PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in
   the C language. Versions 2.12 and prior contain a denial-of-service
   vulnerability that affects PJSIP users that consume PJSIP's XML parsing in
   their apps. Users are advised to update. There are no known workarounds.
   (CVE-2022-24763)
 * A denial-of-service vulnerability affects applications on a 32-bit
   systems that use PJSIP versions 2.12 and prior to play/read invalid WAV
   files. The vulnerability occurs when reading WAV file data chunks with
   length greater than 31-bit integers. The vulnerability does not affect
   64-bit apps and should not affect apps that only plays trusted WAV files. A
   patch is available on the `master` branch of the `pjsip/project` GitHub
   repository. As a workaround, apps can reject a WAV file received from an
   unknown source or validate the file first. (CVE-2022-24792)
 * A buffer overflow vulnerability in versions 2.12 and prior affects
   applications that uses PJSIP DNS resolution. It doesn't affect PJSIP users
   who utilize an external resolver. A patch is available in the `master`
   branch of the `pjsip/pjproject` GitHub repository. A workaround is to
   disable DNS resolution in PJSIP config (by setting `nameserver_count` to
   zero) or use an external resolver instead. (CVE-2022-24793)
