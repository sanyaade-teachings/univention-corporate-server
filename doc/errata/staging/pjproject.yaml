 * Non-maintainer upload by the ELTS team.
 * Fix CVE-2023-27585: PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia
   communication library written in C. A buffer overflow vulnerability affects
   applications that use PJSIP DNS resolver. It doesn't affect PJSIP users who
   do not utilise PJSIP DNS resolver. This vulnerability is related to
   CVE-2022-24793. The difference is that this issue is in parsing the query
   record `parse_query()`, while the issue in CVE-2022-24793 is in
   `parse_rr()`. A workaround is to disable DNS resolution in PJSIP config (by
   setting `nameserver_count` to zero) or use an external resolver
   implementation instead.
