   `splash/SplashClip.cc` (CVE-2019-10873)
 * A remote attacker could exploit a flaw by providing a malicious PDF file
   that, when processed by the program `pdftohtml`, would crash the
   application causing a denial of service (CVE-2020-27778)
 * A logic error in the function `Hints::Hints` allows attackers to cause a
   Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted PDF file (CVE-2022-27337)

   in `JBIGStream.cc`: Processing a specially crafted PDF file or JBIG2 image
