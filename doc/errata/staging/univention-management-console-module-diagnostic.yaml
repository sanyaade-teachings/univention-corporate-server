 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * `52_mail_acl_sync` will no longer fail due to multiple IMAP mail folders
   existing.
 * A new diagnostic plugin has been added to detect cases where the group
   membership attributes 'uniqueMember' and 'memberUid' are no longer
   consistent.
 * `02_certificate_check` now checks if http is available before requesting
   certificates. Otherwise it will use https. The timeout time for requests
   has been reduced to 3 seconds.
