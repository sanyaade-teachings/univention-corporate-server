desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2023-4421: The `NSS` code used for checking `PKCS#1` v1.5 was leaking
   information useful in mounting Bleichenbacher-like attacks. Both the
   overall correctness of the padding as well as the length of the encrypted
   message was leaking through timing side-channel. By sending large number of
   attacker-selected ciphertexts, the attacker would be able to decrypt a
   previously intercepted `PKCS#1` v1.5 ciphertext or forge a signature using
   the victim's key. The issue was fixed by implementing the implicit
   rejection algorithm, in which the `NSS` returns a deterministic random
   message in case invalid padding is detected, as proposed in the Marvin
   Attack paper.
 * CVE-2023-5388: timing attack against RSA decryption.
 * CVE-2024-0743: An unchecked return value in TLS handshake code could have
   caused a potentially exploitable crash.
