 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Vulnerability in the Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM for JDK, Oracle
   GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE (component: Hotspot).
   Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with
   network access via multiple protocols to compromise Oracle Java SE, Oracle
   GraalVM for JDK, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Successful attacks of
   this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete
   access to some of Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM for JDK, Oracle GraalVM
   Enterprise Edition accessible data. Note: This vulnerability can be
   exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through a web
   service which supplies data to the APIs. This vulnerability also applies to
   Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start
   applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code
   (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for
   security (CVE-2024-21131)
 * Vulnerability which can result in unauthorized ability to cause a
   partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM
   for JDK, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Note: This vulnerability can be
   exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through a web
   service which supplies data to the APIs. This vulnerability also applies
   to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web
   Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted
   code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java
   sandbox for security (CVE-2024-21138)
 * Vulnerability which can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete
   access to some of Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM for JDK, Oracle GraalVM
   Enterprise Edition accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to
   a subset of Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM for JDK, Oracle GraalVM
   Enterprise Edition accessible data. Note: This vulnerability can be
   exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through a web
   service which supplies data to the APIs. This vulnerability also applies
   to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start
   applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code
   (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for
   security (CVE-2024-21140)
 * Vulnerability in the Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition
   product of Oracle Java SE (component: Concurrency).
   Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with
   network access via multiple protocols to compromise Oracle Java SE, Oracle
   GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can
   result in unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service
   (partial DOS) of Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Note:
   This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients
   running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets,
   that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the
   internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability
   does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and
   run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator)
   (CVE-2024-21144)
 * Vulnerability in the Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM for JDK, Oracle
   GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE (component: 2D).
   Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with
   network access via multiple protocols to compromise Oracle Java SE, Oracle
   GraalVM for JDK, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Successful attacks of
   this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete
   access to some of Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM for JDK, Oracle GraalVM
   Enterprise Edition accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a
   subset of Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM for JDK, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise
   Edition accessible data. Note: This vulnerability can be exploited by using
   APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through a web service which
   supplies data to the APIs.  This vulnerability also applies to Java
   deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start
   applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code
   (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox
   for security (CVE-2024-21145)
 * Vulnerability in the Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM for JDK, Oracle GraalVM
   Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE (component: Hotspot).
   Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with
   network access via multiple protocols to compromise Oracle Java SE, Oracle
   GraalVM for JDK, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Successful attacks of
   this vulnerability can result in unauthorized creation, deletion or
   modification access to critical data or all Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM
   for JDK, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition accessible data as well as
   unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Oracle Java
   SE, Oracle GraalVM for JDK, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition accessible
   data. Note: This vulnerability can be exploited by using APIs in the
   specified Component, e.g., through a web service which supplies data to
   the APIs.  This vulnerability also applies to Java deployments, typically
   in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed
   Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes
   from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security
   (CVE-2024-21147)
 * New security category for -XshowSettings launcher option (JDK-8281658)
 * Added GlobalSign R46 and E46 root CA certificates (JDK-8316138)
 * Disabled DTLS 1.0 (JDK-8256660)
 * Native executables and libraries on Linux use RPATH instead of RUNPATH
   (JDK-8326891)
