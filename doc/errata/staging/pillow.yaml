fix: 4.0.0-4+deb9u5
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2022-22817: `PIL.ImageMath.eval` in `Pillow` before `9.0.0` allows
   evaluation of arbitrary expressions, such as ones that use the Python
   `exec` method. A `lambda` expression could also be used.
 * CVE-2023-23437: Some Honor products are affected by information leak
   vulnerability, successful exploitation could cause the information leak.
 * CVE-2023-44271: An issue was discovered in `Pillow` before `10.0.0`. It
   is a Denial of Service that uncontrollably allocates memory to process a
   given task, potentially causing a service to crash by having it run out of
   memory. This occurs for `truetype` in `ImageFont` when `textlength` in an
   `ImageDraw` instance operates on a long text argument.
 * CVE-2023-50447: `Pillow` through `10.1.0` allows `PIL.ImageMath.eval`
   Arbitrary Code Execution via the environment parameter, a different
   vulnerability than `CVE-2022-22817` (which was about the expression
   parameter).
