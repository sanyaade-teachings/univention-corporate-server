desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Adds a MSR switch to enable RAPL filtering (default off, once enabled it
   can only be disabled by poweroff or reboot). Useful to protect SGX and
   other threads from side-channel info leak. Improves the mitigation for
   CVE-2020-8694, CVE-2020-8695 on many processors.
 * Mitigates CVE-2021-0127: an unexpected code breakpoint may cause a system
   hang, on many processors.
 * Mitigates CVE-2021-0145: information disclosure due to improper
   sanitization of shared resources (fast-store forward predictor), on many
   processors.
 * Mitigates CVE-2021-0146: VT-d privilege escalation through debug port, on
   Pentium, Celeron and Atom processors with signatures 0x506c9, 0x506ca,
   0x506f1, 0x706a1, 0x706a8
 * Mitigates CVE-2021-33120: out-of-bounds read on some Atom Processors may
   allow information disclosure or denial of service via network access.
