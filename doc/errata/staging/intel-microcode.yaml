desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * New upstream microcode datafile 20230214 - Includes Fixes for: -
   INTEL-SA-00700 (CVE-2022-21216): Insufficient granularity of access control
   in out-of-band management in some Intel(R) Atom and Intel Xeon Scalable
   Processors may allow a privileged user to potentially enable escalation of
   privilege via adjacent network access. - INTEL-SA-00730 (CVE-2022-33972):
   Incorrect calculation in microcode keying mechanism for some 3rd Generation
   Intel(R) Xeon(R) Scalable Processors may allow a privileged user to
   potentially enable information disclosure via local acces - INTEL-SA-00738
   (CVE-2022-33196): Incorrect default permissions in some memory controller
   configurations for some Intel(R) Xeon(R) Processors when using Intel(R)
   Software Guard Extensions which may allow a privileged user to potentially
   enable escalation of privilege via local access. The fix for Intel-SA
   0000738 may require a firmware update to be effective on some processors. -
   INTEL-SA-00767 (CVE-2022-38090): Improper isolation of shared resources in
   some Intel(R) Processors when using Intel(R) Software Guard Extensions may
   allow a privileged user to potentially enable information disclosure via
   local access.
 * Fixes INTEL-SA-00657, CVE-2022-21233 Stale data from APIC leaks SGX memory
   (AEPIC leak)
