 Debian update 3.5.23-5+deb9u10
 3.5.23-5+deb9u10 (Tue, 30 Jan 2024 17:43:02 +0100)
 * Non-maintainer upload by the ELTS team.
 * Fix CVE-2023-50269, CVE-2023-49286, CVE-2023-49285, CVE-2023-46847,
   CVE-2024-23638.
 * Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in Squid, a full
   featured web proxy cache. Due to programming errors in Squid's HTTP request
   parsing, remote attackers may be able to execute a denial of service attack
   by sending large X-Forwarded-For header or trigger a stack buffer overflow
   while performing HTTP Digest authentication. Other issues facilitate a
   denial of service attack against Squid's Helper process management. In
   regard to CVE-2023-46728: Please note that support for the Gopher protocol
   has simply been removed in future Squid versions. There is no fix
   available. We recommend to reject all gopher URL requests instead.
