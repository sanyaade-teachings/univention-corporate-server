 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2023-50269: Due to an Uncontrolled Recursion bug, Squid may be vulnerable to
   a Denial of Service attack against HTTP Request parsing. This problem
   allows a remote client to perform Denial of Service attack by sending a
   large `X-Forwarded-For` header when the `follow_x_forwarded_for` feature is
   configured.
 * CVE-2023-49286: Squid is a caching proxy for the Web supporting `HTTP`,
   `HTTPS`, `FTP`, and more. Due to an Incorrect Check of Function Return Value
   bug Squid is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against its Helper
   process management.
 * CVE-2023-49285: Squid is a caching proxy for the Web supporting `HTTP`,
   `HTTPS`, `FTP`, and more. Due to a Buffer Overread bug Squid is vulnerable to a
   Denial of Service attack against Squid `HTTP Message processing`.
 * CVE-2023-46847: Squid is vulnerable to a Denial of Service, where a remote
   attacker can perform buffer overflow attack by writing up to 2 MB of
   arbitrary data to heap memory when Squid is configured to accept `HTTP
   Digest Authentication`.
 * CVE-2024-23638: Squid is a caching proxy for the Web. Due to an expired
   pointer reference bug, Squid is vulnerable to a Denial
   of Service attack against `Cache Manager` error responses. This problem
   allows a trusted client to perform Denial of Service when generating error
   pages for `Client Manager` reports.
 * CVE-2023-46728: Squid is a caching proxy for the Web supporting `HTTP`,
   `HTTPS`, `FTP`, and more. Due to a `NULL` pointer dereference bug Squid is
   vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against Squid's Gopher gateway.
   Responses triggering this bug are possible to be received from any
   gopher server, even those without malicious intent.
