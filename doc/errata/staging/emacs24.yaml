 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2022-48339: An issue was discovered in GNU Emacs. `htmlfontify.el`
   has a command injection vulnerability. In the `hfy-istext-command` function,
   the parameter file and parameter `srcdir` come from external input, and
   parameters are not escaped. If a file name or directory name contains shell
   metacharacters, code may be executed.
 * CVE-2023-28617: `org-babel-execute:latex` in `ob-latex.el` in Org Mode for
   GNU Emacs allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a file name or
   directory name that contains shell metacharacters.
