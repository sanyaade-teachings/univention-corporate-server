fix: 1.0.2-2+deb9u1
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Heap buffer overflow in the function `de265_image::available_zscan`, which
   can be exploited via a crafted a file. (CVE-2020-21599)
 * An Incorrect Access Control vulnerability exists due to a SEGV in
   `slice.cc`. (CVE-2021-35452)
 * Assertion `scaling_list_pred_matrix_id_delta==1' failed at `sps.cc:925`
   when decoding file, which allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service
   (DoS) by running the application with a crafted file or possibly have
   unspecified other impact. (CVE-2021-36409)
 * A stack-buffer-overflow exists via `fallback-motion.cc` in function
   `put_epel_hv_fallback` when running program `dec265`. (CVE-2021-36410)
 * Incorrect access control by a READ memory access in function
   `derive_boundaryStrength` of `deblock.cc`. The vulnerability causes a
   segmentation fault and application crash, which leads to remote denial of
   service. (CVE-2021-36411)
