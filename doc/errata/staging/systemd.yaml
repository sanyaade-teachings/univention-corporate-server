 This update addresses the following issue:
 232-25+deb9u15 (Tue, 06 Sep 2022 13:42:01 +0200)
 * Non-maintainer upload by the ELTS team.
 * Fix CVE-2022-2526: A use-after-free vulnerability was found in systemd.
   This issue occurs due to the on_stream_io() function and
   dns_stream_complete() function in 'resolved-dns-stream.c' not incrementing
   the reference counting for the DnsStream object. Therefore, other functions
   and callbacks called can dereference the DNSStream object, causing the
   use-after-free when the reference is still used later.
