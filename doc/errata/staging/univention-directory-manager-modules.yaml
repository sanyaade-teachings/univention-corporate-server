 This update addresses the following issues:
 * When the IP address is set when creating a new computer object,
   the DNS entries for this object were not set correctly since erratum
   738. The DNS entries will now be created correctly again.
 * When searching for objects via UDM it was possible to create
   a faulty state, when an object included in the result was deleted
   before the operation was finished. Those deleted objects are now skipped.
