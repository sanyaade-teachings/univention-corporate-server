   attribute indicating that it supports being assigned to an object
   multiple times.
 * A file descriptor leak in the UDM CLI server has been fixed.
 * Fix reaping terminated child processes.
 * Fix a potential infinite loop in handling Samba logon hour syntax.
 * Adjusted DNS object handling to fix compatibility with the UDM REST API.
 * The cron job for deleting expired block list entries now runs
   only if block lists are activated.
 * Fix escaping of DNS labels and names.
 * Allow using domain `home.arpa` from RFC-8375.
 * The StartTLS operation mode is now configurable via the UCR variable
   `directory/manager/starttls`. This is required in a Kubernetes environment.
