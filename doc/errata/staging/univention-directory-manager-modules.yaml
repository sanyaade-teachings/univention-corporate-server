desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * When upgrading the system to 5.2 there is an error when `ppolicy`
   imports `univention` module(s). It is caused by Python interpreter
   version (3.9) - but system's interpreter is already at higher version
   (3.11) so `PyImport_ImportModule` was failing.
