desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * If the UCR variable `directory/manager/mail-address/uniqueness`
   is set to `true` the uniqueness check for email addresses takes
   both user properties, `mailPrimaryAddress` and
   `mailAlternativeAddress`, into account. It is now possible to
   swap the values for these properties with one change to the
   user object.
