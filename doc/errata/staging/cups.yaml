desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * CVE-2024-35235: Starting the `cupsd` server with a Listen configuration
   item pointing to a symbolic link, the cupsd process can be caused to
   perform an arbitrary chmod of the provided argument, providing
   world-writable access to the target. Given that cupsd is often running as
   `root`, this can result in the change of permission of any user or system
   files to be world writable. Given the aforementioned Ubuntu AppArmor
   context, on such systems this vulnerability is limited to those files
   modifiable by the cupsd process.
