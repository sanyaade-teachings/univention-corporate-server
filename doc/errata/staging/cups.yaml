fix: 2.2.1-8+deb9u8A~4.4.9.202205300938
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The cups service killed arbitrary processes on reloads, when duplicate
   jobs were found in the `job.cache` due to leftover uninitialized
   pointers, which should have contained the PID of the printer jobs.
   We now filter duplicate jobs from job.cache to avoid that issue.
 * authorization bypass when using "local" authorization (CVE-2022-26691)
