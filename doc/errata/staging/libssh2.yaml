 * Non-maintainer upload by the LTS Security Team.
 * Fix CVE-2019-13115: integer overflow that could lead to an out-of-bounds
   read in the way packets are read from the server.
 * Fix CVE-2019-17498: the SSH_MSG_DISCONNECT logic in packet.c has an integer
   overflow in a bounds check, enabling an attacker to specify an arbitrary
   (out-of-bounds) offset for a subsequent memory read (closes: #943562).
 * Fix CVE-2020-22218: missing check in _libssh2_packet_add() allows attackers
   to access out of bounds memory.
