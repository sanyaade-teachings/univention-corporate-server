 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2021-40812: The `GD Graphics Library` (aka `LibGD`) has an
   out-of-bounds read because of the lack of certain `gdGetBuf` and `gdPutBuf`
   return value checks.
 * CVE-2021-38115: `read_header_tga` in `gd_tga.c` in the `GD Graphics
   Library` (aka `LibGD`) allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
   (out-of-bounds read) via a crafted `TGA` file.
 * CVE-2018-14553: A `NULL` pointer dereference allowing attackers to crash an
   application via a specific function call sequence. Only affects `PHP` when
