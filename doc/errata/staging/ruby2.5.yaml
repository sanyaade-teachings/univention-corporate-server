 * Non-maintainer upload by the ELTS Security Team.
 * Fix testsuite * Update test certificates. * Update tests for new tzdata. *
   Update tests for Git CVE 2022-39253. * Backport assert_linear_performance.
   * Add missing test for CVE 2023-28756. * Fix flaky test in io_console. *
   Exclude CI-breaking test TestProcess#test_popen_exit. * Exclude flaky test

   TestTime#test_strftime_no_hidden_garbage.
 * CVE-2023-36617: follow-up fix for CVE-2023-28755.
 * CVE-2024-27280: a buffer-overread issue was discovered in StringIO. The
   ungetbyte and ungetc methods on a StringIO can read past the end of a
   string, and a subsequent call to StringIO.gets may return the memory value.
 * CVE-2024-27281: when parsing .rdoc_options (used for configuration in RDoc)
   as a YAML file, object injection and resultant remote code execution are
   possible because there are no restrictions on the classes that can be
   restored. (When loading the documentation cache, object injection and
   resultant remote code execution are also possible if there were a crafted
   cache.)
 * CVE-2024-27282: if attacker-supplied data is provided to the Ruby regex
   compiler, it is possible to extract arbitrary heap data relative to the
   start of the text, including pointers and sensitive strings.

 * Fix lintian error: drop obsolete override.
