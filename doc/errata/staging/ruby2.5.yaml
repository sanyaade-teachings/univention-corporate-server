fix: 2.5.5-3+deb10u7
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * A regular expression related denial of service (ReDoS) issue was
   discovered.  The URI parser mishandles invalid URLs that have specific
   characters. This is a follow-up fix for CVE-2023-28755 (CVE-2023-36617).
 * A buffer-overread issue was discovered. The `ungetbyte` and `ungetc`
   methods on a StringIO can read past the end of a string, and a subsequent
   call to `StringIO.gets` may return the memory value (CVE-2024-27280).
 * When parsing `.rdoc_options` as a YAML file, object injection and
   resultant remote code execution are possible because there are no
   restrictions on the classes that can be restored  (CVE-2024-27281).
 * If attacker-supplied data is provided to the Ruby regex compiler,
   it is possible to extract arbitrary heap data relative to the start of
   the text, including pointers and sensitive strings (CVE-2024-27282).
