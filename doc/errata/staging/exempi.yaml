 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2017-18233: Infinite Loop in Chunk class in
   XMPFiles/source/FormatSupport/RIFF.cpp
 * CVE-2017-18234: Use after free via a PDF file containing JPEG data
 * CVE-2017-18235: Assertion failure in VPXChunk class in
   XMPFiles/source/FormatSupport/WEBP_Support.cpp
 * CVE-2017-18236: Infinite loop in ASF_Support::ReadHeaderObject function in
   XMPFiles/source/FormatSupport/ASF_Support.cpp
 * CVE-2017-18237: NULL pointer dereference in
   PostScript_Support::ConvertToDate function in
   XMPFiles/source/FormatSupport/PostScript_Support.cpp
 * CVE-2017-18238: Infinite loop in TradQT_Manager::ParseCachedBoxes function
   in XMPFiles/source/FormatSupport/QuickTime_Support.cpp
 * CVE-2018-7728: Heap-based buffer overflow in
   third-party/zuid/interfaces/MD5.cpp:MD5Update() allows for denial of
   service via crafted TIFF image
 * CVE-2018-7729: Stack-based buffer overflow in
   XMPFiles/source/FileHandlers/PostScript_Handler.cpp:PostScript_MetaHandler::ParsePSFile()
   allows for denial of service
 * CVE-2018-7730: Heap-based buffer overflow in PSD_MetaHandler::CacheFileData
   function in XMPFiles/source/FormatSupport/PSIR_FileWriter.cpp allows for
   denial of service via crafted XLS file
 * CVE-2018-7731: NULL pointer dereference in
   XMPFiles/source/FormatSupport/WEBP_Support.cpp:WEBP::VP8XChunk allows for
   denial of service via crafted file
 * CVE-2018-12648: NULL pointer dereference in
   WEBP_Support.hpp:WEBP::GetLE32() allows for denial of service
 * CVE-2021-36045: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability that could lead to
   disclosure of arbitrary memory. An attacker could leverage this
   vulnerability to bypass mitigations such as ASLR.
 * CVE-2021-36046: Memory corruption vulnerability, potentially resulting in
   arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
 * CVE-2021-36047: Improper Input Validation vulnerability potentially
   resulting in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
 * CVE-2021-36048: Improper Input Validation vulnerability potentially
   resulting in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
 * CVE-2021-36050: Buffer overflow vulnerability potentially resulting in
   arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
 * CVE-2021-36051: Buffer overflow vulnerability potentially resulting in
   arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
 * CVE-2021-36052: Memory corruption vulnerability, potentially resulting in
   arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
 * CVE-2021-36053: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability that could lead to
   disclosure of arbitrary memory. An attacker could leverage this
   vulnerability to bypass mitigations such as ASLR.
 * CVE-2021-36054: Buffer overflow vulnerability potentially resulting in
   local application denial of service in the context of the current user.
 * CVE-2021-36055: Use-after-free vulnerability that could result in arbitrary
   code execution in the context of the current user.
 * CVE-2021-36056: Buffer overflow vulnerability potentially resulting in
   arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
 * CVE-2021-36057: Write-what-where condition vulnerability caused during the
   application's memory allocation process. This may cause the memory
   management functions to become mismatched resulting in local application
   denial of service in the context of the current user.
 * CVE-2021-36058: Integer Overflow vulnerability potentially resulting in
   application-level denial of service in the context of the current user.
 * CVE-2021-36064: Buffer Underflow vulnerability which could result in
   arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
 * CVE-2021-39847: Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability potentially
   resulting in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
 * CVE-2021-40716: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability that could lead to
   disclosure of sensitive memory. An attacker could leverage this
   vulnerability to bypass mitigations such as ASLR.
 * CVE-2021-40732: NULl pointer dereference vulnerability that could result in
   leaking data from certain memory locations and causing a local denial of
   service in the context of the current user.
 * CVE-2021-42528: NULL pointer dereference vulnerability when parsing a
   specially crafted file. An unauthenticated attacker could leverage this
   vulnerability to achieve an application denial-of-service in the context of
   the current user.
 * CVE-2021-42529: Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability potentially
   resulting in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
 * CVE-2021-42530: Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability potentially
   resulting in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
 * CVE-2021-42531: Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability potentially
   resulting in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
 * CVE-2021-42532: Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability potentially
   resulting in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
