desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Local DoS by event-busy-loop from writing long lines to
   /run/avahi-daemon/socket (CVE-2021-3468)
 * avahi-daemon-check-dns.sh in the Debian avahi package through 0.8-4 is
   executed as root via /etc/network/if-up.d/avahi-daemon, and allows a local
   attacker to cause a denial of service or create arbitrary empty files via a
   symlink attack on files under /run/avahi-daemon. NOTE: this only affects
   the packaging for Debian GNU/Linux (used indirectly by SUSE), not the
   upstream Avahi product. (CVE-2021-26720)
