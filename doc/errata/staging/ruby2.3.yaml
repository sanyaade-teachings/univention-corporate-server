 * Non-maintainer upload by the ELTS Security Team.
 * Fix testsuite * Update test certificates. * Update tests for new tzdata. *
   Update tests for Git CVE 2022-39253. * Backport assert_linear_performance.
   * Fix flaky test TestRipper::Generic#test_parse_files. * Fix flaky tests in
   io_console. * autopkgtest: make use of the text exclusion rules under
   test/excludes/
 * CVE-2021-28965: the REXML gem does not properly address XML round-trip
   issues. An incorrect document can be produced after parsing and
   serializing.
 * CVE-2021-33621: the cgi gem allows HTTP response splitting. This is
   relevant to applications that use untrusted user input either to generate
   an HTTP response or to create a CGI::Cookie object.
 * CVE-2022-28739: buffer over-read occurs in String-to-Float conversion,
   including Kernel#Float and String#to_f.
 * CVE-2023-28755: a ReDoS issue was discovered in the URI component. The URI
   parser mishandles invalid URLs that have specific characters. It causes an
   increase in execution time for parsing strings to URI objects.
 * CVE-2023-28756: a ReDoS issue was discovered in the Time component. The
   Time parser mishandles invalid URLs that have specific characters. It
   causes an increase in execution time for parsing strings to Time objects.
 * CVE-2023-36617: follow-up fix for CVE-2023-28755.
 * CVE-2024-27281: when parsing .rdoc_options (used for configuration in RDoc)
   as a YAML file, object injection and resultant remote code execution are
   possible because there are no restrictions on the classes that can be
   restored. (When loading the documentation cache, object injection and
   resultant remote code execution are also possible if there were a crafted
   cache.)
 * CVE-2024-27282: if attacker-supplied data is provided to the Ruby regex
   compiler, it is possible to extract arbitrary heap data relative to the
   start of the text, including pointers and sensitive strings.
 * Reference missing symbols rb_big_hash@Base (fixes:
   symbols-file-contains-current-version-with-debian-revision)
 * Fix lintian error: drop obsolete override.
