desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2022-4883: When processing files with .Z or .gz extensions, the
   library calls external programs to compress and uncompress files, relying
   on the PATH environment variable to find these programs, which could allow
   a malicious user to execute other programs by manipulating the PATH
   environment variable.
 * CVE-2022-44617: When processing a file with width of 0 and a very large
   height, some parser functions will be called repeatedly and can lead to an
   infinite loop, resulting in a Denial of Service in the application linked
   to the library.
 * CVE-2022-46285: When parsing a file with a comment not closed an
   end-of-file condition will not be detected, leading to an infinite loop and
   resulting in a Denial of Service in the application linked to the library.
