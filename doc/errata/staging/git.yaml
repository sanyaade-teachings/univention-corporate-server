 This update addresses the following issues:
 1:2.11.0-3+deb9u8 (Sun, 09 Oct 2022 22:03:52 +0200)
 * Non-maintainer upload by the ELTS team.
 * Fix CVE-2021-40330: git_connect_git in connect.c in Git before 2.30.1
   allows a repository path to contain a newline character, which may result
   in unexpected cross-protocol requests, as demonstrated by the
   git://localhost:1234/%0d%0a%0d%0aGET%20/%20HTTP/1.1 substring.
 * Fix CVE-2021-21300: In affected versions of Git a specially crafted
   repository that contains symbolic links as well as files using a
   clean/smudge filter such as Git LFS, may cause just-checked out script to
   be executed while cloning onto a case-insensitive file system such as NTFS,
   HFS+ or APFS (i.e. the default file systems on Windows and macOS).
