 8u362-ga-4 (Wed, 01 Feb 2023 18:14:37 +0100)
 * Revert blhc warning quieting, the buildsystem has bugs
 8u362-ga-3 (Wed, 01 Feb 2023 17:46:44 +0100)
 * Use compat 10, not 11 as openjdk-11/17 do: 11 is deprecated in favour of
   either 10 or 12
 8u362-ga-2 (Wed, 01 Feb 2023 17:23:02 +0100)
 * Drop shark VM build glue: documented to just crash; depends on ancient LLVM
   version; no way forward, dropped upstream
 * Drop kfreebsd-*, as the patches have needed updating and fixing for years,
   and the architectures are, sadly, in a bad state
 * Disable -Werror where not yet done (SCTP): it breaks ia64 (and possibly
   elsewhere) as this old code is not adapted to newer glibcs of bookworm/sid,
   etc.
 * Fix a sparc64 build error patching around GCC deficiency
 * Switch to jtreg6 for the testsuite, on distros that package it
 * Transition libfreetype6-dev → libfreetype-dev (where applicable)
 * Bump Policy, (on recent releases only) debhelper compat
 * Try to appease changes in lintian override formats
 * Limit tzdata-java Breaks to exactly stretch and xenial
 * Plug a few build warnings
 * Build -Os not -O3 on mipsel, cf. #971018 for this workaround idea

 * Make openjdk-8 the default Java version in jessie, following the change in
   java-common 0.52+deb8u1. This bumps Java 8's priority in the alternatives
   system. Make sure update-alternatives is called for installed versions with
   priority lower than the new one.
 * Use dynamic priority for testing whether u-a needs to be run
