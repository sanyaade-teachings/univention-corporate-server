 This update addresses the following issues:
 * According to the documentation the -Z flag could be used to control the
   behavior of the StartTLS command. However, the flag was found to be
   non-functional.
   For backwards compatibility, the flag is kept,
   but the references in the documentation have been removed.
 * In order to control the behavior the -z flag is introduced, which allows
   to disable the certificate validate or the entire StartTLS command (-zz).
   This may be useful for testing.
   Existing systems are not affected and require no changes.
