 * Non-maintainer upload by the ELTS team.
 * Two security problems were found in PHP, a widely-used open source general
   purpose scripting language, which could result in information disclosure or
   incorrect validation of password hashes.
 * Fix CVE-2024-2756: Marco Squarcina discovered that network and same-site
   attackers can set a standard insecure cookie in the victim's browser which
   is treated as a `__Host-` or `__Secure-` cookie by PHP applications. This
   issue stems from an incomplete fix to CVE-2022-31629.
 * Fix CVE-2024-3096: Eric Stern discovered that if a password stored with
   password_hash() starts with a null byte (\x00), testing a blank string as
   the password via password_verify() incorrectly returns true. If a user were
   able to create a password with a leading null byte (unlikely, but
   syntactically valid), the issue would allow an attacker to trivially
   compromise the victim's account by attempting to sign in with a blank
   string.
