 * Non-maintainer upload by the ELTS team.
 * Fix CVE-2023-3823: In PHP various XML functions rely on libxml global state
   to track configuration variables, like whether external entities are
   loaded. This state is assumed to be unchanged unless the user explicitly
   changes it by calling appropriate function. However, since the state is
   process-global, other modules - such as ImageMagick - may also use this
   library within the same process, and change that global state for their
   internal purposes, and leave it in a state where external entities loading
   is enabled. This can lead to the situation where external XML is parsed
   with external entities loaded, which can lead to disclosure of any local
   files accessible to PHP. This vulnerable state may persist in the same
   process across many requests, until the process is shut down.
 * Fix CVE-2023-3824: In PHP when loading phar file, while reading PHAR
   directory entries, insufficient length checking may lead to a stack buffer
   overflow, leading potentially to memory corruption or RCE.
