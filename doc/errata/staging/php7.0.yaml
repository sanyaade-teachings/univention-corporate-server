 * Non-maintainer upload by the ELTS team.
 * Fix CVE-2024-5458: Due to a code logic error, filtering functions such as
   filter_var when validating URLs (FILTER_VALIDATE_URL) for certain types of
   URLs the function will result in invalid user information (username +
   password part of URLs) being treated as valid user information. This may
   lead to the downstream code accepting invalid URLs as valid and parsing
   them incorrectly. The problem is related to CVE-2020-7071, but affects IPv6
   host parts.
 * Correct some variable types for the original fix for CVE-2020-7071. This is
   more consistent with the latest iteration and addresses some failing tests.
