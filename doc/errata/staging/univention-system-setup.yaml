 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The process to renew all SSL/TLS certificates has been improved. For each
   host the symbolic link pointing to the fully-qualified host name is now
   created as a relative link. Error cases are better detected and handled.
   All changed SSL/TLS profile settings are now propagated into a new CA.
