desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2021-37600: An integer overflow in `util-linux` can potentially cause a
   buffer overflow if an attacker were able to use system resources in a way
   that leads to a large number in the `/proc/sysvipc/sem` file. NOTE: this is
   unexploitable in GNU C Library environments, and possibly in all realistic
   environments.
 * CVE-2024-28085: Wall in `util-linux`, often installed with `setgid` `tty`
   permissions, allows escape sequences to be sent to other users' terminals
   through `argv`. (Specifically, escape sequences received from `stdin` are
   blocked, but escape sequences received from `argv` are not blocked.) There
   may be plausible scenarios where this leads to account takeover.
