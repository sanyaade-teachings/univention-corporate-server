 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The permissions of `/var/univention-backup/samba` where not
   restricted to root and Domain Admins. By default in UCS ssh
   access to domain controllers is restricted to "Domain Admins",
   but this erratum implements tightened access control to that
   backup folder and the files created there.
