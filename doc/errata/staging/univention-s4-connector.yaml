 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Group member DNs with containing special characters
   that require escaping can be notated in different
   ways. When comparing them, this has not been taken
   into consideration, leading to rejects and tracebacks
   in the log file. This has been fixed.
 * The StartTLS operation mode is now configurable via the UCR variable
   `directory/manager/starttls`. This is required in a Kubernetes environment.
