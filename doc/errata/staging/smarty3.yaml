desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * Smarty is a template engine for PHP, facilitating the separation of
   presentation (HTML/CSS) from application logic. Prior to versions 3.1.45
   and 4.1.1, template authors could inject php code by choosing a malicious
   {block} name or {include} file name. Sites that cannot fully trust template
   authors should upgrade to versions 3.1.45 or 4.1.1 to receive a patch for
   this issue. There are currently no known workarounds. (CVE-2022-29221)
