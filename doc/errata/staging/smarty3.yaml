 * Smarty is a template engine for PHP, facilitating the separation of
   presentation (HTML/CSS) from application logic. Prior to versions 3.1.42
   and 4.0.2, template authors could run arbitrary PHP code by crafting a
   malicious math string. If a math string was passed through as user provided
   data to the math function, external users could run arbitrary PHP code by
   crafting a malicious math string. Users should upgrade to version 3.1.42 or
   4.0.2 to receive a patch. (CVE-2021-29454)
