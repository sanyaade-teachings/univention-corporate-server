 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Joining a backup node into a single server UCS@school environment
   failed because the ldb module univention_samaccountname_ldap_check
   attempted to create an object of type computers/windows for it
   which always failed because the account name was already taken
   by the computers/domaincontroller_backup object.
 * An error restarting Samba during during package installation has
   been fixed.
