desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * samba-tool now supports passing credentials using the options
   -A|--authentication-file.
 * samba-tool now supports passing machine password using the option
   --machinepass-file.
 * In some cases, in UCS@school the log.smbd filled with a message
   because a Windows 10 client attempted to access user files, which
   is denied by the NTACLs. While the origin of that behavior is still
   unknown, no negative side effects are known. To avoid overflowing
   the log file, we adjusted the log message to only start appearing at
   the debug level 2. Default log level is 1.
