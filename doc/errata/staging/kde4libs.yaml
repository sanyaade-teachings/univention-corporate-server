 This update addresses the following issue:
 4:4.14.26-2+deb9u1 (Sun, 17 Mar 2024 14:26:28 +0530)
 * Non-maintainer upload by the ELTS team.
 * Fix CVE-2019-14744: Dominik Penner discovered a flaw in how KConfig
   interpreted shell commands in desktop files and other configuration files.
   An attacker may trick users into installing specially crafted files which
   could then be used to execute arbitrary code, e.g. a file manager trying to
   find out the icon for a file or any application using KConfig. Thus the
   entire feature of supporting shell commands in KConfig entries has been
   removed.
