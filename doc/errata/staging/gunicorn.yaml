version: [9]
scope: ucs_4.4-0-errata4.4-9
src: gunicorn
fix: 19.6.0-10+deb9u3
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * Fix autopkgtest and encode string to byte object.
 * Fix gunicorn Python 2 library and replace fullmatch function in
   CVE-2024-1135-part3.patch with match again because fullmatch only exists on
   Python 3. Compile regex with \Z to detect the pattern at the end of the
   line which apparently satisfies the corresponding tests and causes no
   regression.
 * CVE-2024-1135: Gunicorn fails to properly validate Transfer-Encoding
   headers, leading to HTTP Request Smuggling (HRS) vulnerabilities. By
   crafting requests with conflicting Transfer-Encoding headers, attackers can
   bypass security restrictions and access restricted endpoints. This issue is
   due to Gunicorn's handling of Transfer-Encoding headers, where it
   incorrectly processes requests with multiple, conflicting Transfer-Encoding
   headers, treating them as chunked regardless of the final encoding
   specified. This vulnerability allows for a range of attacks including cache
   poisoning, session manipulation, and data exposure.
