 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Erratum 785 introduced a new mechanism in `ucs_registerLDAPExtension`
   to re-trigger the activation of an LDAP ACL or schema extension by
   doing a trivial (i.e. no-op) LDAP modification. This failed on the
   Primary node due to missing credentials. `ucs_registerLDAPExtension`
   has been fixed to use the LDAP admin connection in this case.
