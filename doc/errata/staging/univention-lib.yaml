 This update addresses the following issues:
 * During setup of an AD-Connection as member of an AD domain
   via either initial UCS System Setup or via the UMC wizard
   AD-Connection a DNS record for SSO gets created automatically.
   Until now, the UCR variable `ucs/server/sso/fqdn` was used for that
   with `ucs-sso` as default. This update adjusts this to use the
   UCR variable `keycloak/server/sso/fqdn` instead, with `ucs-sso-ng`
   as default.
