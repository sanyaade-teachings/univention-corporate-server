scope: ucs_5.0-0-errata5.0-8
src: univention-keycloak
fix: 1.0.12-3
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The univention-keycloak CLI was fixed, so that you can use --set
   multiple times in the domain-config sub command, as documented.
 * There was an error where a provided XML file during serviceprovider
   creation overwrote the options passed on the `CLI`. This resulted in
   some of the migration guide example creations not working anymore.
