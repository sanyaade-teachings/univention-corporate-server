 This update addresses the following issues:
 1:6.1.5-3~deb9u1 (Fri, 08 Sep 2023 20:01:47 +0000)
 [ Rene Engelhard ]
 * Rebuild for stretch-backports.
 * debian/patches/apparmor-{cleanups,mesa,opencl}.diff, debian/patches/series,
   debian/rules: revert this and apparmor >= 2.13.1 recommends; stretch
   doesn't have apparmor on per default but let's go sure
 * debian/control.in, debian/patches/series,
   debian/libreoffice-base-drivers.NEWS,
   debian/patches/use-mariadb-java-instead-of-mysql-java.diff: revert for
   stretch-backports...
 * debian/patches/disableClassPathURLCheck.diff: revert configure check for
   stretch-backports
 * tarballs/*, debian/source/include-binaries: include needed internal stuff
 [ Bastien Roucariès ]
 * Upload to stretch as a backport
 * Import patch for 1:6.1.5-3+deb10u10
 * Use external xmlsec in order to avoid FTBFS
 1:6.1.5-3+deb10u10 (Sat, 12 Aug 2023 19:58:29 +0000)
 * CVE-2023-2255: Improper access control in editor components of LibreOffice
   allowed an attacker to craft a document that would cause external links to
   be loaded without prompt. In the affected versions of LibreOffice documents
   that used "floating frames" linked to external files, would load the
   contents of those frames without prompting the user for permission to do
   so. This was inconsistent with the treatment of other linked content in
   LibreOffice.
 1:6.1.5-3+deb10u9 (Fri, 11 Aug 2023 19:09:29 +0000)
 * Team upload by the LTS team
 * CVE-2022-3874: Libreoffice may be configured to add an empty entry to the
   Java class path. This may lead to run arbitrary Java code from the current
   directory.
 * CVE-2023-0950: Improper Validation of Array Index vulnerability in the
   spreadsheet component allows an attacker to craft a spreadsheet document
   that will cause an array index underflow when loaded. In the affected
   versions of LibreOffice certain malformed spreadsheet formulas, such as
   AGGREGATE, could be created with less parameters passed to the formula
   interpreter than it expected, leading to an array index underflow, in which
   case there is a risk that arbitrary code could be executed.
 1:6.1.5-3+deb10u8 (Sat, 25 Mar 2023 10:55:37 +0000)
 * Add salsa testsuite
 * CVE-2022-26307: add Initialization Vectors to password storage. LibreOffice
   supports the storage of passwords for web connections in the user’s
   configuration database. The stored passwords are encrypted with a single
   master key provided by the user. A flaw in LibreOffice existed where master
   key was poorly encoded resulting in weakening its entropy from 128 to 43
   bits making the stored passwords vulerable to a brute force attack if an
   attacker has access to the users stored config.
 * fix CVE-2022-26306: LibreOffice supports the storage of passwords for web
   connections in the user’s configuration database. The stored passwords are
   encrypted with a single master key provided by the user. A flaw in
   LibreOffice existed where the required initialization vector for encryption
   was always the same which weakens the security of the encryption making
   them vulnerable if an attacker has access to the user's configuration data
 * CVE-2022-26305: compare authors using Thumbprint An Improper Certificate
   Validation vulnerability in LibreOffice existed where determining if a
   macro was signed by a trusted author was done by only matching the serial
   number and issuer string of the used certificate with that of a trusted
   certificate. This is not sufficient to verify that the macro was actually
   signed with the certificate. An adversary could therefore create an
   arbitrary certificate with a serial number and an issuer string identical
   to a trusted certificate which LibreOffice would present as belonging to
   the trusted author, potentially leading to the user to execute arbitrary
   code contained in macros improperly trusted.
 * CVE-2021-25636: only use X509Data LibreOffice supports digital signatures
   of ODF documents and macros within documents, presenting visual aids that
   no alteration of the document occurred since the last signing and that the
   signature is valid. An Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in
   LibreOffice allowed an attacker to create a digitally signed ODF document,
   by manipulating the documentsignatures.xml or macrosignatures.xml stream
   within the document to contain both "X509Data" and "KeyValue" children of
   the "KeyInfo" tag, which when opened caused LibreOffice to verify using the
   "KeyValue" but to report verification with the unrelated "X509Data" value.
 * CVE-2022-3140: Insufficient validation of "vnd.libreoffice.command" URI
   schemes. LibreOffice supports Office URI Schemes to enable browser
   integration of LibreOffice with MS SharePoint server. An additional scheme
   'vnd.libreoffice.command' specific to LibreOffice was added. In the
   affected versions of LibreOffice links using that scheme could be
   constructed to call internal macros with arbitrary arguments. Which when
   clicked on, or activated by document events, could result in arbitrary
   script execution without warning.
 1:6.1.5-3+deb10u7 (Mon, 08 Mar 2021 13:13:24 +0100)

   bare trailing : in PYTHONPATH as it causes unconditional loading of

 1:6.1.0~rc1-2 (Thu, 05 Jul 2018 21:31:20 +0000)
 * rebuild with correct control (all languages...)
 1:6.1.0~rc1-1 (Wed, 04 Jul 2018 23:50:05 +0200)
 * debian/rules: - make the tests fatal again (where they were before -

 * debian/rules: - allow fontforge additionally to of fontforge-nox - remove
   custom build-opensymbol target; use new --enable-build-opensymbol - fix
   i386 conditional for not adding a (not fullfillable on stretch even with
   backports) default-jdk (>= 2:1.9) build-dep - don't enable dwz on
   stretch-backports, the needed debhelper conflicts against the (needed via
   libgpgmepp-dev) stable qt5-qmake :/ - remove USE_DWZ_MULTIFILE conditional
   (which was disabled), default since debhelper 11.3 - make
   BUILD_TEST_PACKAGES=y be based on DEB_BUILD_PROFILES, not DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS
   - enable gtk3_kde also on 32bit archs - ignore test failures for now; broke
   already in beta1-1 but was hidden by the do-not-hide-test-output.diff bug,
   so no regression. Needs to be investigated.
 * debian/control.test-packages.in: - add Build-Profiles: <!nocheck>
 * debian/control.sdk.in: - add Build-Profiles: <!nodoc> for -dev-doc

   too long without an output
 * debian/patches/no-ant-check-if-unneeded.diff: as name says, only check for
   ant if we really need it for building something
 * debian/rules: - build-depend on fontforge-nox and rebuild opens___.tff from
   OpenSymbol.sfd - fix numbertext-data-recommends substvar - optimize the
   build-indep build a bit more + remove build-indep dependency on build-arch
   to not run the full testsuite on -A (build-indep) builds. Only run the odk
   "check" (SDK files) and build-example tests + build without
   --enable-symbols on build-indep builds - enable (gtk3_)kde5 (and qt5) only
   on 64bit archs for now - make -help-xx depend with = on -help-common and
   -help-common depend on x-www-browser, too, it already contains HTML -
   rebuild smoketestdoc.sxw; install it into libreoffice-smoketest-data - move
   ant to Build-Depends-Indep
 * debian/tests/odk-build-examples: fix
 * debian/control.in: move numbertext-data-recommends to Depends: as the
   numbertext stuff is used for ooxml im/export.. (theoretical, since
   libnumbertext depends on it already, but...)
 * debian/copyright: add the various (c)'s of OpenSymbol.sfd
 * debian/libreoffice-help-common.links: symlink normalize.css to
   /usr/share/javascript/normalize.css/normalize.css and depend on
   libjs-normalize.css, but mention ./help3xsl/normalize.css in copyright

   parts ourselves. Add missing LD_LIBRARY_PATH and use
   /usr/share/libreoffice/smoketestdoc.sxw. Enable - honour $ADTTMP - rename
   junit-subsequentcheck to junit - add "uno" test running the bridgetest
   using /usr/lib/libreoffice/uno. only depends on "ure" - run "perl
   odk/util/check.pl /usr/lib/libreoffice/sdk"
 * debian/rules, debian/control.systray.in: the systray "Quickstarter" is
   finally gone upstream.
 1:6.1.0~beta1~git20180507-1 (Mon, 07 May 2018 20:42:58 +0000)
 * New upstream snapshot
 * debian/patches/disable-tests-somehow-needing-more-fonts.diff,
   debian/patches/tdf108963-test.diff: remove. Obsolete after Liberation fix

 * debian/libreoffice-help.doc-base.in: ... here and only use as template.
   Update Index: for localized "index" (text/shared/main0108.html) and fix
   Section:
 * debian/rules: - move also the -help-common parts to /usr/share -
   create/populate libreoffice-help-xx .doc-base files - use internal
   libetonyek on stretch-backports - use -type f for pupulating Files: in
   .doc-base to leave out dirs... - stop special-casing i386 to explicitly use
   openjdk (9), use default-java again and add appropriate versioned
   build-depends - install the language-specific media/helpimg/xx into their
   correct packages - fix build with -B/all (unpackaged help) languages - add
   Build-Conflicts: against "broken" fonts-liberation - remove explicit
   SAL_USE_VCLPLUGIN="svp" from make check call since it's apparently unneeded
   (and even actually harmful) now
 * debian/rules, debian/control.in: add stuff for new libnumbertext usage
 * debian/lo-java-ref.in: move to Programming/Java
 * debian/tests/odk-build-examples: build also new split-out

   explicit python3-distutils build-dependency as python3.6 3.6.5~rc1-2

   then. Move from Build-Depends-Indep: to Build-Depends: again; - update ar

 jodconverter/natbraille in testing... And linux 4.14.2-1 is also supposed to
 fix the regression finally...
 This also

   install the OpenSymbol fontconfig snippet into a
   /etc/fonts.d/30_opensymbol.conf - change BRAND_BASE_DIR in fundamentalrc so

 * debian/patches/disable-tests-somehow-needing-more-fonts.diff: ... here and
   patch also ooxmlexport4
 * debian/rules: - use (dh_)dwz and (if enabled) install the multifile file
   into uno-libs3-dbgsym. Thanks Matthias Klose for the hint. Make *-dbgsym
   depend on uno-libs3-dbgsym which should contain the above file and is
   recommended anyway because of the gdb helpers. - be consequent and enable
   the junit tests on arm64 now that those work. - stop passing
   --disable-database-connectivity for no-Base archs - explicitly use and
   depend on openjdk 9 on i386 now that #876069 is fixed. -
 replace some manual dpkg-parsechangelog calls with $(DEB_VERSION) and
 $(DEB_DISTRIBUTION) and fix logic for --disable-dependency-tracking - enable

 now

   $DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_PACKAGE and update version

   apparmor profiles (add missing /). mv_conffile the files to the new name...
 * debian/control.in: make -core conflict against openjdk-{6,7,8}-jre-headless

 * debian/control.in: - add fonts-noto-hinted, fonts-noto-mono,
   fonts-noto-unhinted to Recommends - clean up mozilla suggests to just
   firefox-esr | thunderbird | firefox - add versions to
   openjdk-{7,8}-jre-headless conflicts now that they are also supposed to be
   fixed
 * debian/control.{kde.}.in: suggest the "certificate managers" for gpg: gpa,
   seahorse, kleopatra | kgpg

   package
 * debian/rules: - finally stop building -systray. GNOME 3.26 doesn't show it

   add from master, fixing CppunitTest_vcl_filters_test on arm*

   and the removal of the explicit default -fstack-protector-strong here.
 * debian/patches/arm64-bridges-no-stack-protector-strong.diff: add from
   master: go sure that we build gcc3_linux_aarch64/cpp2uno.cxx only with
   -fstack-protector. Works for us by chance because of above
   debian-hardened-buildflags-no-LO-fstack-protector-strong.diff
 * debian/patches/arm64-disable-sc-functions-test.diff: add patch from master
   to disable the sc_*_functions_test on arm64 (as for x86).
 * debian/rules: - *really* fix -dbgsym 0775 permissions by manually fixing
   them after mkdir -p's (dh_fixperms doesn't run on -dbgsym) which apparently
   create them as 775 (at least on the buildds) - fix
   libreoffice-dev-doc.doc-base.lo-idl-ref (again) - add missing dependency to
   build-arch to install-arch - make armhf/arm64 test failures fatal now that
   above test is fixed which was the only one failing; upstream apparently
   also builds armhf/arm64 flatpaks now for flathub
 * debian/copyright: - fix various missing-license-paragraph-in-dep5-copyright
 1:5.4.2-3 (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 21:28:41 +0200)

   testTableKeep test, fails with --without-fonts even though Liberation is in
   Build-Depends:...

   upgrades involving jessie since jessies version gets kept on
   jessie->stretch upgrades...

 * debian/control.help.in: drop now obsolete Depends on

 1:5.4.2~rc1-1 (Fri, 22 Sep 2017 09:21:11 +0200)
 * debian/patches/icu-no-icu-config.diff: don't use icu-config for determining
   the ICU version; doesn't exist in (Debian's) ICU 59.1 anymore
 * debian/rules: - move STRETCH_BACKPORT conditional for coinmp lower in rules
   so it gets honoured and make libwps/libmwaw internal unconditionally
   (RUN_MAKE_CHECK=n on BE archs)... - move images_helpimg.zip to usr/share
   like the others; remove obsolete helpimg mangling in the "other"
   images_*.zip
 * debian/control.in: remove -style-default provides since it doesn't help at
   all on default changes; depend on tango since that apparently is now the
   (last) fallback
 * debian/control.gtk?.in: remove -style-tango recommends, obsoleted by above

 * debian/rules: - install appstream stuff into /usr/share/metainfo. sigh. -
   make -writer-dbgsym recommend -core-dbgsym as it wants some gdb stuff from
   it - set UNO_LIBS_DBG_ROOT to fix gdb helper installation for uno-libs3
   again and make -core-dbgsym recommends uno-libs3-dbgsym (same reason as
   above) - generate and install apparmor profiles - be consequent and bump
   the build-dependencies for the DLP libs when we run the tests; based on
   patch by Rico Tzschichholz - run dh_strip_nondeterminism - disable -kde and
   the (unmaintained for LO) oxygen theme. Qt4 should go away. See
   https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2017/08/msg00006.html - set
   locale to en-US.UTF-8 also for make check, the dbaccess tests fail in some
   frenchy locale... - remove libbz2-dev from Build-Depends, coinutils got
   fixed - move pagein-{calc,draw,impress,writer} to their respective packages

   Tzschichholz

   remove build-needed
 * debian/tests/control, debian/tests/sdk-examples: move ...

 * debian/tests/odk-build-examples: actually set -e...
 * debian/rules, debian/tests/control: remove extra hackery to add our
   Build-Depends(-Indep): to debian/tests/control.in; misses some packages
   (e.g. ant) and it should work at least since autopktest 3.16 from Jul 2015;
   use @builddeps@ instead
 * debian/tests/control, debian/tests/*uno-import.diff: split; make
   pyuno-import test import pyuno while uno-import does import uno (the
   uichecks do the former). Add python3 dependency for safety.
 * debian/test/control: sort by importance
 * debian/tests/: unapply patch after the make (or on error) so that the next
   test can patch it...
 * debian/tests/*: more cleanups for newer autopkgtests; use allow-stderr
   instead of manual 2>&1
 * debian/rules: - be consequent and set RUN_PYTESTS=n (and
   RUN_MAKE_UICHECK=n) where we set RUN_MAKE_CHECK=n - be consequent and add
   $(IGNORE_MAKE_CHECK_FAILURES) also to the "extra" test runs - disable the
   tests on bigendian archs: hang (failures non-fatal anyway.) - make i386
   make check notfatal for now given the i386 Java Stack Clash regression

   Java arch, so let's remove the Java5 alternatives
 * debian/copyright, debian/source/include-binaries: remove xmlsec
 * debian/rules: - fix dh_missing call
 * debian/tests/sdk-examples: DevelopersGuide/OfficeDev/DesktopEnvironment

 * debian/control.in: make -core depend on ure (>= 5.4.0~beta2~)
 * debian/control.in: - make -gstreamer recommend gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad as

   Not insert->docunent but close enough, so this (unfortunately only using
   internal pdfium. sigh.)
 * debian/scripts/gid2pkgdirs.sh, debian/control{,.transitionals}.in: remove
   extra libreoffice-pdfimport, merge (even though the poppler dependency...)
   back to -common/-core since it has the above new feature and otherwise it
   may get confusing what is what.
 * debian/rules, debian/patches/cppunit-optional.diff: as name says; make
   cppunit build-dep optional and add <!nocheck> to the build-dep

   debian/source/include-binaries, debian/libreoffice-core.lintian-overrides:
   include pdfium; override embedded-library for lcms2
 * debian/rules: - adapt for (upcoming) usage of dh_missing - run
   build-nocheck with --without-junit --without-cppunit to configure and run
   check with them; build the checks with gb_SUPPRESS_TESTS first before
   running them - replace symlinks /usr/share/applications/*.desktop. move
   /usr/lib/libreoffice/share/xdg/*.desktop (except qstart.desktop) to them
   instead. Fixes e.g. appstream-generator for our appstream data (which
   cannot handle the symlinks...) - enable running make uicheck
 1:5.3.3-2 (Sat, 27 May 2017 10:52:43 +0200)
 * debian/patches/sensible-lomua.diff: sync upstreams "add xdg-email as the
   default email route" into here
 * debian/rules: - fix logic error; make -g1 etc work also with noddebs. Build
   with those flags also if building no -dbgsym - move DPKG_EXPORT_BUILDFLAGS
   and buildflags.mk include later to make it effective (worked before,
   but...) - fix /usr/share/libreoffice/program/classes/unoil.jar symlink
 * debian/control.in: - remove obsolete Pre-Depends
 * debian/rules, debian/control.in: remove now unneeded dejavu-depends
   substvar, simply use fonts-dejavu. Move from Depends: to Recommends: like
   the other fonts
 * debian/copyright: fix (add missing .'s)
 1:5.3.3-1 (Thu, 04 May 2017 20:33:52 +0200)
 * debian/control.in: - recommend new fonts-open-sans
 1:5.3.2-1 (Wed, 29 Mar 2017 12:48:44 +0200)
 * debian/patches/help-msg-add-package-info.diff,
   debian/patches/mention-java-common-package.diff,
   debian/patches/mediawiki-oor-replace.diff: debian/patches/series: actually
   update the patches and re-enable...
 * debian/rules: - move /usr/include/libreoffice/sal/typesizes.h symlink to
   -dev instead of -dev-common
 * debian/control.in: - add missing -java-common Depends: to
   -script-provider-{bsh,js}
 * debian/control.mediawiki.in: - add missing JRE depends
 (thanks to Daniel Richard G. for those two, see #858655)
 * debian/control.in: - make libreoffice meta-package only recommend
   libreoffice-java-common
 1:5.3.1-1 (Wed, 08 Mar 2017 02:02:25 +0100)
 * debian/rules, debian/libreoffice-dev-doc.links, debian/lo*.in: install SDK
   documentation into /usr/share/doc/libreoffice/sdk (and adapt dev-docs
   symlinks/doc-base stuff). Remove extra license file (thanks lintian) which
   otherwise would still install over the symlink.
 * debian/control.sdk.in: update -devs libreoffice-dev-doc Conflicts to (<<
   1:5.2.5-2~) and add Conflicts: libreoffice (<< 1:5.2.5-2~) to both -dev*-
   for safety
 * debian/rules: - enable mergelibs only on 64bit archs (and i386), ld goes to
   OOM on mips(el) for example... - allow build with gold (maybe for LTO?) -
   ignore "libreoffice" for --link-doc - fix dh_installdocs calls to install
   copyright for "libreoffice" - symlink
   /usr/share/libreoffice/program/classes/unoil.jar to
   /usr/share/java/unoil.jar to "dedup" it - run rdfind to get duplicated
   /usr/share/icons/gnome symlinked to hicolor if identical; add
   rdlink/symlinks B-D-I - fix generating lo-idl-ref doc-base file
 * debian/control.in, debian/rules, debian/scripts/cleandupes: remove unused
   fdupes B-D-I and commented-out usage
 * debian/rules, debian/control.in: recommend -sdbc-firebird only where it's
   built (LE) to prepare for it being a dependency when firebird will be the
   default embedded engine
 1:5.3.0-1 (Wed, 01 Feb 2017 01:25:24 +0100)
 * debian/rules: - add support for building with clang - move from hardcoded
   C(XX)FLAGS for -g -> -g1 to recommended DEB_C(XX)FLAGS_MAINT_*
 * debian/missing-sources: - add source of jquery 3.1.1 (from libjs-jquery
   package) for helpcontent2/source/jquery-3.1.1.min.js
 1:5.3.0~rc2-1 (Tue, 17 Jan 2017 01:31:09 +0100)
 * debian/patches/change-from-glew-to-epoxy.diff: update
 * debian/patches/m68k-use-mlong-jump-table-offsets.diff: add; as name says

   -mlong-jump-table-offsets
 1:5.3.0~rc1-2 (Sat, 24 Dec 2016 01:01:40 +0100)
 * debian/rules: - readd somehow lost libgl1-mesa-dev build-dependency...
 1:5.3.0~rc1-1 (Fri, 23 Dec 2016 21:17:03 +0100)
 * debian/patches/change-from-glew-to-epoxy.diff: backport from master; as
   name says
 * debian/patches/gtk3-opengl-slideshow.diff: backport from master to fix
   ogltrans generically with gtk3
 * debian/patches/disable-flaky-tests.diff: also disable svx.AccessibleShape
 * debian/control.ogltrans.in: - add Conflicts: libreoffice-gtk3 (<<
   1:5.2.4~rc2)
 * debian/rules: - change glew conditionals/build-deps to epoxy -
   ENABLE_GDRIVE=y again on armhf and arm64
 1:5.3.0~beta2-1 (Sun, 11 Dec 2016 10:40:18 +0100)
 * debian/patches/m68k-alignment.diff: add patch from John Paul Adrian
   Glaubitz to fix m68k alignment
 * debian/libreoffice-sdbc-firebird.NEWS: add NEWS entry about the format
   incompatibility
 * debian/rules: revert ENABLE_GDRIVE=y on arm* as chromium got uploaded
   without it to sid and it's gone from experimental again on those
 1:5.3.0~beta1-1 (Wed, 23 Nov 2016 12:43:18 +0100)
 * try using just the used tarballs to avoid confusion and to shrink the .orig
   (they are downloaded anyway and not in the .orig) - remove unneeded
   tarballs from tarballs - include needed tarballs in include-binaries -
   update debian/copyright (remove many, add forgotten swingEx fix src ->
   tarballs; actually add MPL-2.0/ASF blurb) - update README.Debian-source
 * debian/patches/fix-system-lpsolve-build.diff: rename to ..
 * build-against-shared-lpsolve.diff: ... this to make the purpose more clear
 * debian/patches/fix-system-lpsolve-build.diff: add new one adding
   -llpsolve55_pic test/linkage (disabled)
 * debian/patches/no-openssl.diff: don't uselessly check for openssl and don't
   require openssl in postgresql-sdbc-impl, not (directly) used
 * debian/scripts/get_libvlc_dep.sh: fix to work again (also) with new
   multiarchified libvlc5
 * debian/rules: - don't install ChangeLog (now done automatically by dh
   compat >= 7) as it doubles -common/-core size and increases font-opensymbol
   *by 10* - ENABLE_GDRIVE=y also on armhf and arm64 as we've chromium there
   now, too - enable mysql-connector again now that libmysqlcppconn _and_
   mysql-workbench are built against mariadb. Bump Build-Dependency on
   libmysqlcppconn to >= 1.1.7-4 to go sure we're getting a >= 1.1.7
   dependency Fix adding the libmysqlcppconn-dev Build-Dep in the default case
 * debian/control.in: - add Breaks: browser-plugin-libreoffice to
   libreoffice-core
 * debian/control.firebird.in: fix substvar: s/server/engine/
 * debian/libreoffice-common.maintscript: remove apparently unneeded quotes
   which now breaks at dpkg-maintscript-helper call...

 * New upstream alpha release - fixes typo in VCL.xcu; s/Tino/Tinos/ - fixes
   (experimental) Gtk print dialog crash - fixes copy paste cells between two
   tables of two documents with Gtk3 - fixes tooltips when dragging/filling
   cells with Gtk3

   versioned Provides
 * debian/rules, debian/control.transitionals.in: remove jessie->stretch
   transitionals again
 * debian/rules, control.gcj.in: cleanup: - remove support for gcj (and thus
   building -gcj "native") completely; removed upstream; and also openjdk-9
   apparently will drop support for source/target 1.5 (which gcj only
   supports) and gcc-7 apparently even will drop gcj, too (also the
   officeotron/odfvalidator stuff fails because due to the java-gcj in the
   path for safety reasons it picks up gcj..) - use java6_architectures for
   computing OOO_JAVA_ARCHS
 * debian/copyright: add schema/*/* to Files-Excluded: :/
 * debian/uno-libs3.symbols: update
 * debian/rules: - bump dh compat to 10 - re-enable firebird
