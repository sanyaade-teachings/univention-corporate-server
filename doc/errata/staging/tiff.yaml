desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2023-3576: A memory leak flaw was found in Libtiff's `tiffcrop`
   utility. This issue occurs when `tiffcrop` operates on a `TIFF` image file,
   allowing an attacker to pass a crafted `TIFF` image file to `tiffcrop`
   utility, which causes this memory leak issue, resulting an application
   crash, eventually leading to a denial of service.
 * CVE-2023-52356: A segment fault (`SEGV`) flaw was found in `libtiff` that
   could be triggered by passing a crafted `tiff` file to the
   `TIFFReadRGBATileExt()` `API`. This flaw allows a remote attacker to cause
   a heap-buffer overflow, leading to a denial of service.
