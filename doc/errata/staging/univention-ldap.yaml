 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Errata update 991 improved the LDAP filters for DNS objets in UDM
   but we forgot to add an LDAP index for the sOARecord attribute
   there. This update fixes that and should improve the performance
   of the UMC modules `computers` and `school computers`, especially
   for teachers in UCS@school environments, which are subject to a
   larger number of LDAP ACLs.
