desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Allow configuring the LDAP overlay slapd-sock
   for `sockresps extendedresults` via UCR variable
   `ldap/overlay/sock`.
 * Once activated, it outputs LDAP changes including
   LDIF for CRUD operations (not for search).
 * Allow activating `sockops add delete modify modrdn` via
   UCR variable `ldap/overlay/sock/sockops`.
 * Please note that activating that second UCR variable
   causes the slapd process to wait for confirmation for
   CRUD events (see `man slapd-sock`), so don't activate
   this unless there is a process responding to the
   socket `/var/lib/univention-ldap/slapd-sock`.
bug: [57267]
