fix: 16.0.15-8
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Even though all OCs inherit from top and actually are found when
   searching for `(objectClass=top)`, the (inherited)
   `objectClass: top` does not show up as an attribute in the output
    of `ldapsearch`.
 * The udm module `settings/extended_attributes` has been updated to
   include the property `preventUmcDefaultPopup` which is evaluated
   in the `UMC` and will inhibit it from warning the user that
   the default value of a property will be set during modification.
