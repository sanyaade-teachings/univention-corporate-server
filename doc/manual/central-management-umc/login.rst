Login
=====

UCS provides a central login page.
You can sign in to the |UCSWEB| with the credentials of the respective domain account.
On the portal at :samp:`https://{FQDN}/univention/portal/` you can use the following ways to sign in:

* Click the tile :guilabel:`Login` on the portal page.

* Go to :menuselection:`Menu --> Login`.

It opens the login page as shown in :numref:`umc-login`.

.. _umc-login:

   UCS sign-in page

If a page in the management system, such as a UMC module, requires a login,
your browser redirects you to the central login page.

When you sign in at the local UCS system,
the browser session closes by default after 8 hours of inactivity.
You can change the timeout through the UCR variable :envvar:`umc/http/session/timeout`.
To get a new the session, the user must sign in again.

To sign out of the management system, click :guilabel:`Logout` in the user menu.

By installing a third-party application, such as :program:`privacyIDEA`, it's possible to extend
the |UCSWEB| authentication with a two-factor authentication (2FA).

Refresh portal tabs on logout or session timeout
------------------------------------------------

All browser tabs where the user is logged into the portal will automatically refresh when a logout is detected.
The same applies if the session times out.
This feature is enabled by default and can be toggled through the UCR Variable :envvar:`portal/reload-tabs-on-logout`.

Choose the right user account
-----------------------------

To sign in, enter the *Username* and *Password* of the corresponding domain account in the login mask.

``Administrator``
   When you sign in with the ``Administrator`` account on a |UCSPRIMARYDN| or |UCSBACKUPDN|,
   the UCS management system shows the UMC modules
   for the administration and configuration of the local system,
   as well as,
   UMC modules for the administration of data in the domain.

   You specified the initial password for the ``Administrator`` account
   in the setup wizard during installation.
   The password corresponds to the initial password of the local ``root`` account.
   Use the ``Administrator`` account for the initial sign in at a newly installed |UCSPRIMARYDN|.

``root``
   In some cases, it might be necessary to sign in with the system's local ``root`` account.
   For more information, refer to :ref:`computers-rootaccount`.
   The ``root`` account only enables access to UMC modules for the administration and configuration of the local system.

Other user accounts
   When you sign in with another user account,
   the UCS management system shows the UMC modules approved for the user.
   For additional information on allowing further modules, refer to :ref:`delegated-administration`.

Single sign-on
--------------

By default, the login page for the portal has single sign-on deactivated.
The following sections describe how to activate single sign-on.
After a successful sign in,
the session is valid for all UCS systems of the domain,
as well as, for third party apps,
if the apps support web based single sign-on.

For sign-in through single sing-on,
the browser session closes for 8 hours of inactivity.
To get a fresh session, the user must sign in again.

It's possible to enforce the sign in on the local system
by clicking the link :guilabel:`Login without Single Sign On` on the login page,
as show in :numref:`umc-login-sso`.

.. _central-management-umc-login-single-sign-on-saml:

SAML for single sign-on
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

UCS has SAML activated by default.
This section describes how to activate it for the *Login* buttons in the Portal.
For more information about SAML, refer to :ref:`domain-saml`.

Activate
""""""""

To activate single sign-on through SAML, use the following steps:

#. Ensure that all users in your domain
   who want to use the portal and the UCS management system with single sign-on
   can reach :samp:`ucs-sso.{[Domain Name]}`.

#. Change the |UCSUCRV| :envvar:`portal/auth-mode` to ``saml`` with :option:`ucr set`.
   The default value was ``ucs``.

#. For the change to take effect, restart the portal server with the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ systemctl restart univention-portal-server.service

Update sign-in links
""""""""""""""""""""

Restarting the portal server automatically updates the *Login* link in the user menu.
You must manually update the portal tile.
The default portal has a preconfigured single sign-on login tile.
Use the portal edit mode to enable it.
To replace the *Login* tile with the single sign-on tile,
follow these steps:

#. In *Univention Management Console* open the UMC Module Portal:
   :menuselection:`Domain --> Portal`.

#. To activate the preconfigured sign in tile for SAML,
   edit the entry ``login-saml``,
   scroll down to the section *Advanced*
   and activate the checkbox :guilabel:`Advanced`.

#. To deactivate the default sign in tile,
   edit the entry ``login-ucs``,
   scroll down to the section *Advanced*
   and deactivate the checkbox :guilabel:`Advanced`.

To change back to the default sign-in in UCS without single sign-on,
you need to revert the steps for updating the portal tile
and set the UCR variable :envvar:`portal/auth-mode` to ``ucs``.

.. _central-management-umc-login-single-sign-on-oidc:

OpenID Connect for single sign-on
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

   Using OpenID Connect for single sign-on to the portal and the UCS management system
   **isn't covered** by Univention product support.
   Don't use it in production environments.

.. versionadded:: 5.0-6-erratum-947

   With :uv:erratum:`5.0x947` the portal and the UCS management system
   have the capability to allow single sign-on with OpenID Connect.
   The capability is deactivated by default.

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a protocol that allows single sign-on.
OIDC is a more lightweight protocol than SAML.
It's one variant for using single sign-on in the portal and the UCS management system.
This section describes how to use it with UCS.

Requirements
""""""""""""

Before you can use OIDC for single sign-on, you must meet the following requirements:

#. You must at least have :uv:erratum:`5.0x947` installed throughout your UCS domain.

   For information about how to upgrade, refer to :ref:`software-ucs-updates`.

#. You must have the app :program:`Keycloak` installed in your UCS domain.

   For information about the installation of :program:`Keycloak`,
   refer to :external+uv-keycloak-ref:ref:`app-installation`
   in :cite:t:`ucs-keycloak-doc`.

Activate
""""""""

First, you need to decide on which UCS systems you want to enable single sign-on using OpenID Connect.
Second, you need to apply the following steps to each of those UCS systems.

#. Deactivate SAML for portal sign-in through the UCR variable :envvar:`umc/web/sso/enabled`
   so that the automatic to sign in again doesn't try SAML first, but instead uses OIDC directly.

   Change the |UCSUCRV| :envvar:`umc/web/oidc/enabled` to ``true`` with :option:`ucr set`.

   .. code-block:: console

      $ ucr set \
         umc/web/sso/enabled=false \
         umc/web/oidc/enabled=true

#. Run the join script for the UMC web server:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ univention-run-join-scripts \
         --force \
         --run-scripts \
         92univention-management-console-web-server.inst

Verification and log files
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To verify that the setup works,
open the URL :samp:`https://{FQDN}/univention/oidc` in a web browser, such as Mozilla Firefox,
and sign in.
Open a UMC module, such as *Users*, and perform a search.

You find relevant logging information in the following locations:

* Log file: :file:`/var/log/univention/management-console.server.log`

* :program:`journald`: :command:`journalctl -u slapd.service`

To reflect the changes for the login method in the portal,
you need to edit the *Login* tile manually,
similar to the setup with :ref:`central-management-umc-login-single-sign-on-saml`.
The link must point to ``/univention/oidc/``.

Deactivate
""""""""""

First, you need to decide on which UCS systems you want to deactivate single sign-on using OpenID Connect.
Second, you need to apply the following steps to each of those UCS systems.

#. Unset the |UCSUCRV| :envvar:`umc/web/oidc/enabled` with :option:`ucr unset`:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ ucr unset umc/web/oidc/enabled

#. Remove the :external+uv-keycloak-ref:term:`OIDC RP` from Keycloak with the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ univention-keycloak oidc/rp remove \
         "$(ucr get umc/oidc/$(hostname -f)/client-id)"

#. Unset all |UCSUCRVs| that you can find with the following searches:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ ucr search --brief --key ^umc/oidc
      $ ucr search --brief --key ^ldap/server/sasl/oauthbearer

#. Remove the OIDC secret from the system and restart affected services:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ rm -f \
         /etc/umc-oidc.secret \
         /usr/share/univention-management-console/oidc/http*
      $ systemctl restart slapd.service univention-manangement-console

#. Manually update the portal tile for *Login*,
   so that the link points to ``/univention/login/``.
