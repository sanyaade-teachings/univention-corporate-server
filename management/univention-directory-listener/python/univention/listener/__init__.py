Listener module API

To create a listener module (LM) with this API, create a Python file in
:file:`/usr/lib/univention-directory-listener/system/` which includes:

1. a subclass of :py:class:`ListenerModuleHandler`
2. with an inner class `Configuration` that has at least the class attributes `name`, `description` and `ldap_filter`

See :file:`/usr/share/doc/univention-directory-listener/examples/` for examples.
