"""
Module and object specific for all "mail/*" UDM modules.

This module handles the problem that on a OX system, UDM modules are registered
for oxmail/ox$NAME, that opens LDAP objects with both
``univentionObjectType=oxmail/ox$NAME`` *and*
``univentionObjectType=mail/$NAME``.

:py:meth:`GenericModule._verify_univention_object_type()` raises a
:py:exc:`WrongObjectType` exception when loading it.

The overwritten method :py:meth:`_verify_univention_object_type()` allows both
mail/* and oxmail/* in univentionObjectType.
