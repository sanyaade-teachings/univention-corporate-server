# Bug #49440: Switch "insserv" from "SysV" to "systemd" mode to make it use
# "-f" to ignore wrong runtime-dependency of "univention-bind" on "samba-ad-dc"
# in non-Samba4-environments, which is called through "update-rc.d" from
# "bind9.postinst" and breaks the upgrade of old systems installed with
# "sysv-rc" before UCS-4.2
