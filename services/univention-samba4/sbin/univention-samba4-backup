# Revised 2013-09-25, Brian Martin, as follows:
#    - Allow retention period ("DAYS") to be specified as a parameter.
#    - Allow individual positional parameters to be left at the default
#      by specifying "-"
#    - Use IS0 8601 standard dates (yyyy-mm-dd instead of mmddyyyy).
#    - Display tar exit codes when reporting errors.
#    - Don't send error messages to /dev/null, so we know what failed.
#    - Suppress useless tar "socket ignored" message.
#    - Fix retention period bug when deleting old backups ($DAYS variable
#      could be set, but was ignored).
